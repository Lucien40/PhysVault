# Main ideas

#important : Generally, in QFT we do not have an adequate direct definition of the basis states. Instead we will see how to construct normalizable states $\ket{f_1,\dots,f_n;\text{in }}$ and $\ket{g_1,\dots,g_n;\text{in}}$ by applying suitable explicitly defined operators to the vacuum.
