#definition : perturbation theory, any quantum field model is characterized by a Lagrangian, which is represented as a sum of a free-field part and an interaction part, L = L0+LI

#definition : Amplitudes of the model, e.g. S-matrix elements and Green functions, are represented as power series in coupling constants.

#important : lines correspond to L0 and vertices are determined by LI

#definition : unrenormalized S-matrix is given by

#definition : the relation

#definition : Di is the propagator of the field of type i

#definition : colons denote a normal product of the free fields

#important : x set to zero in the integrand.

#important : the graph, the

#important : corresponding Feynman amplitude and the integral are all often called the ‘diagram’.

analytically evaluate a two-loop Feynman diagram which depends on two parameters, e.g. a mass squared and a momentum squared

the parameters involved differ in scale

#important : expand the diagram in their small ratio

#important : first of them, expansion by regions, is physically motivated and turns out to be more general

consider phenomena at a given scale, Λ.

#conclusion : consider small all the masses and kinematical invariants that are below this scale

#conclusion : remaining parameters as large

#important : expect that the corresponding expansion has the form

#definition : x = m2/Q2 and ω is the degree of divergence of the graph Γ

#important : these expectations are, in general, a matter of experience rather than a corollary of a mathematical theorem

#important : even if the original Feynman integral is finite, it is necessary to introduce a regularization,

#important : necessity for the regularization is explained by the fact that, without it, it is very difficult to provide simple explicit prescriptions for the terms of the expansion;

#useful : 2

> should this de squared?

#important : Therefore the terms in the large parentheses are mutually cancelled after this expansion and calculation, and we arrive at the expansion of the given integral (3.7), written as (3.15)

#important : Nevertheless, these poles are cancelled in the sum of the two contributions for every power of the expansion parameter

#condition : expanding integrals

#condition : arbitrary rational functions f (q, m, k) with positive denominators in the limit q m:

#condition : Divide the integration domain into various regions and, in every region, expand the integrand into a Taylor series with respect to the parameters that are considered small there.

#condition : Integrate every expanded integrand over the whole integration domain and sum the resulting contributions from all the regions.

#important : we shall not really use the word ‘region’ to denote a domain determined by inequalities,

#important : word in the physical sense and imply relations between the quantities involved that determine an order of the integration variables, expressed in terms of the parameters of the problem

#important : why not consider a region of the type k ∼ m2/q?

#important : scaleless integrals

#important : third one, which provides zero values for scaleless integrals

#condition : Suppose that we want to expand a Feynman integral in some limit of momenta and masses. Let us follow the rules formulated in \[18\]

#definition : Divide the space of the loop momenta into various regions and, in every region, expand the integrand into a Taylor series with respect to the parameters that are considered small there

#definition : Integrate the integrand, expanded in the appropriate way in every region, over the whole integration domain of the loop momenta.

#definition : Set to zero any scaleless integral

#condition : the Euclidean sense is implied

#condition : For example, k2 is considered large and we do not bother about possible cancellation of k2 0 and k2 in the combination k2 = k2 0

#condition : the region of small k
