  abstract = {Using the multivariate residue calculus of Leray, we give a precise definition of the notion of a cut Feynman integral in dimensional regularization, as a residue evaluated on the variety where some of the propagators are put on shell. These are naturally associated to Landau singularities of the first type. Focusing on the one-loop case, we give an explicit parametrization to compute such cut integrals, with which we study some of their properties and list explicit results for maximal and next-to-maximal cuts. By analyzing homology groups, we show that cut integrals associated to Landau singularities of the second type are specific combinations of the usual cut integrals, and we obtain linear relations among different cuts of the same integral. We also show that all one-loop Feynman integrals and their cuts belong to the same class of functions, which can be written as parametric integrals.},

As in the case of previously known prescriptions for various limits of momenta and masses, the terms of the threshold expansion are associated with subgraphs of a given graph and are explicitly written through Taylor expansions of the corresponding integrands in certain sets of parameters. They are manifestly homogeneous in the threshold expansion parameter, so that the calculation of the given Feynman integral near the threshold reduces to the calculation of integrals of a much simpler type. The general method is illustrated by two-loop two-point and three-point diagrams. We discuss the use of the threshold expansion for problems of physical interest, such as the next-to-next-to-leading order heavy quark production cross sections close to threshold and matching calculations and power counting in non-relativistic effective theories.},

Loop integrals appear when evaluating the Feynman diagrams with one or more loops by integrating over the internal momenta. Even though this problem has already been in place since the mid-twentieth century, we not only do not understand how to calculate all classes of these integrals beyond one loop, we do not even know in what class of functions the answer is expressed. To partially solve this problem, different variations of new functions called usually elliptic multiple polylogarithms have been introduced in the last decade. In this paper, we explore the possibilities and limitations of this class of functions.

The essential features of this integral are illustrated by means of a simplified toy model, and we attach the relevant expressions for both integrals in ancillary files. We propose a normalization for such integrals that renders all of their polylogarithmic degenerations pure, and we discuss the need for a new ``symbology'' of mixed iterated elliptic and polylogarithmic integrals in order to bring them to a more canonical form.},

These can be directly applied to the computation of four-mass scalar integral coefficients, and we explicitly present results in next-to-next-to-MHV amplitudes. For scalar box functions with at least one massless external leg we show that by doing the computation in signature (--++) the coefficients can also be obtained from quadruple cuts, which are not useful in Minkowski signature. As examples, we reproduce the coefficients of some one-, two-, and three-mass scalar box integrals of the seven-gluon next-to-MHV amplitude, and we compute several classes of three-mass and two-mass-hard coefficients of next-to-MHV amplitudes to all multiplicities.},

  abstract = {We introduce a class of iterated integrals, defined through a set of linearly independent integration kernels on elliptic curves. As a direct generalisation of multiple polylogarithms, we construct our set of integration kernels ensuring that they have at most simple poles, implying that the iterated integrals have at most logarithmic singularities. We study the properties of our iterated integrals and their relationship to the multiple elliptic polylogarithms from the mathematics literature. On the one hand, we find that our iterated integrals span essentially the same space of functions as the multiple elliptic polylogarithms. On the other, our formulation allows for a more direct use to solve a large variety of problems in high-energy physics. We demonstrate the use of our functions in the evaluation of the Laurent expansion of some hypergeometric functions for values of the indices close to half integers.},

  abstract = {We present a generalization of the symbol calculus from ordinary multiple polylogarithms to their elliptic counterparts. Our formalism is based on a special case of a coaction on large classes of periods that is applied in particular to elliptic polylogarithms and iterated integrals of modular forms. We illustrate how to use our formalism to derive relations among elliptic polylogarithms, in complete analogy with the non-elliptic case. We then analyze the symbol alphabet of elliptic polylogarithms evaluated at rational points, and we observe that it is given by Eisenstein series for a certain congruence subgroup. We apply our formalism to hypergeometric functions that can be expressed in terms of elliptic polylogarithms and show that they can equally be written in terms of iterated integrals of Eisenstein series. Finally, we present the symbol of the equal-mass sunrise integral in two space-time dimensions. The symbol alphabet involves Eisenstein series of level six and weight three, and we can easily integrate the symbol in terms of iterated integrals of Eisenstein series.},

Our recursive framework is based on manipulating iterated integrals on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. A geometric parameter appears as variable of a differential equation of KZ or KZB type. The parameter interpolates between two associated regularized boundary values, which contain iterated integrals closely related to scattering amplitudes defined on two different geometries.},

This is a flat connection over a principal bundle on the moduli space of elliptic curves with marked points. It restricts to a flat connection on configuration spaces of points on elliptic curves, which can be used for proving the formality of the pure braid groups on genus 1 surfaces. We study the monodromy of this connection and show that it gives rise to a relation between the KZ associator and a generating series for iterated integrals of Eisenstein forms. We show that the universal KZB connection is realized as the usual KZB connection for simple Lie algebras, and that in the \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathfrak \{sl\}\_n\textbackslash ) case this realization factors through the Cherednik algebras. This leads us to define a functor from the category of equivariant D-modules on \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathfrak \{sl\}\_n\textbackslash ) to that of modules over the Cherednik algebra, and to compute the character of irreducible equivariant D-modules over \textbackslash (\textbackslash mathfrak \{sl\}\_n\textbackslash ) that are supported on the nilpotent cone.},

The completion of the mock Jacobi form restores the modular symmetries expected from AdS3/CF T2 holography but has a holomorphic anomaly reflecting the non-compactness of the microscopic CFT. For every positive integral value m of the magnetic charge invariant of the black hole, our analysis leads to a special mock Jacobi form of weight two and index m, which we characterize uniquely up to a Jacobi cusp form. This family of special forms and another closely related family of weight-one forms contain almost all the known mock modular forms including the mock theta functions of Ramanujan, the generating function of Hurwitz-Kronecker class numbers, the mock modular forms appearing in the Mathieu and Umbral moonshine, as well as an infinite number of new examples.},

In Sect. 14.1.1, after having introduced the affine Lie algebras per se, we show how the fundamental concepts of roots, weights, Cartan matrices, and Weyl groups are extended to the affine case. Section 14.2 introduces the outer automorphism group of affine Lie algebras, which is generated by the new symmetry transformations of the extended Dynkin diagram. The following section describes highest-weight representations, focusing on those whose highest weight is dominant. Characters for these representations are introduced in Sect. 14.4. Their modular properties are presented in the following sections, where various properties of their modular S matrices are also reported. The affine extension of finite Lie algebra embeddings is presented in Sect. 14.7. Four appendices complete the chapter. The first one contains the proof of a technical identity related to outer automorphism groups. The second appendix displays an explicit basis (in terms of semi-infinite paths) for the states in integrable representations of affine su(N). In the third one, the modular transformation properties of the affine characters are derived. The final appendix lists all the symbols pertaining to affine Lie algebras.},

Indeed, there exists in two dimensions an infinite variety of coordinate transformations that, although not everywhere well-defined, are locally conformal: they are holomorphic mappings from the complex plane (or part of it) onto itself. Among this infinite set of mappings one must distinguish the 6-parameter global conformal group, made of one-to-one mappings of the complex plane into itself. The analysis of the previous chapter still holds when considering these transformations only. However, a local field theory should be sensitive to local symmetries, even if the related transformations are not globally defined. It is local conformal invariance that enables exact solutions of two-dimensional conformal field theories.},

  abstract = {This chapter describes a representation of the conformal fields of minimal models in terms of vertex operators built from a free boson with special boundary conditions. This representation bears the name of Coulomb gas or modified Coulomb gas. This terminology comes from the resemblance of the free boson correla \textbackslash (\textbackslash left\textbackslash langle \{\textbackslash varphi (z,\textbackslash bar z)\} \textbackslash right.\textbackslash left. \{\textbackslash varphi (w,\textbackslash bar w)\} \textbackslash right\textbackslash rangle = - \textbackslash ln \{\textbackslash left| \{z - w\} \textbackslash right|\^2\}\textbackslash ) with the electric potential energy between two unit charges in two dimensions. In Sect. 9.1, we calculate the correlation function of vertex operators and indicate how the symmetry {$\varphi$} \textrightarrow{} {$\varphi$} + a of the boson theory imposes a constraint (the neutrality condition) on this correlation function. We then modify the free-boson action\textemdash or, equivalently, the energy-momentum tensor\textemdash and this modifies the central charge and the neutrality condition. This section is supplemented by App. 9.A, where the calculation of the modified energy-momentum tensor is detailed. In Sect. 9.2, we introduce the notion of screening operators and describe how the insertion of such operators in bosonic correlation functions allows for a sort of projection onto minimal-model correlation functions. Examples of correlation functions are calculated. Finally, in Sect. 9.3, we explain the general structure of the minimal-model correlation functions in this formalism. Special attention is devoted to the properties of conformal blocks, and the idea of a conformal field theory defined on a surface of arbitrary genus is introduced. The mathematical setting of the Coulomb-gas representation of minimal models (i.e., BRST cohomology of the bosonic Fock spaces) is described in App. 9.B.},

As in any rational conformal field theory, fusion rules can be calculated from the Verlinde formula, in terms of the modular transformation matrices S. For WZW models, all these matrices are known explicitly. However, working out a few examples is convincing enough that the Verlinde formula is not very convenient for explicit calculations. Indeed, the dimension of the matrix S grows very quickly with the level and the rank of the algebra. Nevertheless, the formula itself allows us to derive useful identities (which is done in Sect. 16.1), in addition to being the starting point for a more efficient approach: the affine extension of the character method used for the calculation of tensor products in finite Lie algebra. This method is described in Sect. 16.2. It leads to a very nice relation between tensor-product coefficients and fusion coefficients. The concept of quantum dimension, naturally related to the character method, is introduced in Sect. 16.3.},

In elaborating more complex systems involving scores of epicycles and eccentrics, they gave up the idea that celestial orbits should be explicitly symmetric, but invented unknowingly the concept of ``hidden symmetry'', for the circle remained the building block of their cosmology. Modern science, with Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, gave symmetry a deeper realm: that of the physical ``laws.'' Circles gave way to ellipses and more complicated trajectories; the richness and variety of Nature became, in the Heavens like on Earth, compatible with symmetric laws, even without the exterior appearance of symmetry.},

The present chapter is devoted to particularly simple conformal theories called minimal models. These theories are characterized by a Hilbert space made of a finite number of representations of the Virasoro algebra (Verma modules); in other words, the number of conformal families is finite. Such theories describe discrete statistical models (e.g., Ising, Potts, and so on) at their critical points. Their simplicity in principle allows for a complete solution (i.e., an explicit calculation of all the correlation functions). The discovery of minimal models and their identification with known statistical models at criticality constitutes the greatest application of conformal invariance so far. Since a detailed study of minimal models may rapidly become highly technical, we have split the discussion among two chapters (this one and the next). The present chapter first explains some general features of Verma modules (Sect. 7.1), and in particular the occurrence of states of zero norm, which must be quotiented out. In Sect. 7.2 the question of unitarity is discussed and the Kac determinant is introduced. In Sect. 7.3 a survey of the theory of minimal models is presented. In Sect. 7.4 various examples of the correspondence between minimal theories and statistical systems are described. The next chapter will be devoted to more technical issues and will provide proofs for some assertions of the present chapter.},

However, this situation is very unphysical. The decoupling exists only at the fixed point in parameter space (the conformally invariant point) and in the infinite-plane geometry. The physical spectrum of the theory should be continuously deformed as we leave the critical point, and the coupling between right and left sectors away from this point should lead to some constraints on the left and right content of the theory at the fixed point. In operator language, this implies that not every left-right combination of Verma modules is physically sound.},

Our aim in this chapter is to present a detailed study of its continuum limit, in the framework of conformally invariant (free fermionic or bosonic) field theories. After reviewing basic facts on the statistical-mechanical model, we concentrate on its continuum fermionic representation. This framework is particularly suitable for the computation of correlation functions of the energy operator on the plane. For correlations involving the spin operator, it is more convenient to consider a bosonic field theory, made of two independent Ising models. In this bosonic formulation, the spin operator has a simple realization in terms of the free field. To complete the study of correlators, we also present the solution of the continuum Ising model on the torus, and use it as an illustrative example of the general theory of conformal blocks covered in Chaps. 9 and 10.},

  abstract = {This chapter initiates the analysis of conformal field theories with Lie-algebraic symmetry, for which an affine Lie algebra \^g arises as the spectrum-generating algebra. Such models are somewhat peculiar among conformal field theories in that they can be formulated directly in terms of an action. We will thus introduce them by means of this action and show how to extract from it their algebraic structure, which provides them with an alternative algebraic definition. Special emphasis is placed on the formulation of the concept of primary field, and its relation with the integrable representations of the affine algebra \^g. A key construction along this program is that of the Sugawara energy-momentum tensor, which is presented in great detail. It leads directly to a differential equation for the correlation functions, the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, of which simple solutions are presented. In the second part of the chapter, we present various free-field representations. In addition to being extremely useful computational tools, they provide an illustration of the different concepts introduced in the first part.},

When evaluated at certain special values of the arguments, eMPLs reduce to another class of special functions, defined as iterated integrals of Eisenstein series. As a novel application of our formalism, we illustrate how a class of special functions introduced by Remiddi and one of the authors can always naturally be expressed in terms of either eMPLs or iterated integrals of Eisenstein series for the congruence subgroup \$\textbackslash Gamma(6)\$.},

We argue that a good choice of basis for (multi)loop integrals can lead to significant simplifications of the differential equations, and propose criteria for finding an optimal basis. This builds on experience obtained in supersymmetric field theories that can be applied successfully to generic quantum field theory integrals. It involves studying leading singularities and explicit integral representations. When the differential equations are cast into canonical form, their solution becomes elementary. The class of functions involved is easily identified, and the solution can be written down to any desired order in {$\epsilon$} within dimensional regularization. Results obtained in this way are particularly simple and compact. In this Letter, we outline the general ideas of the method and apply them to a two-loop example.},

The subsequent phase-space integrations are performed via the reverse unitarity method familiar from collider physics, using differential equations to obtain the exact velocity dependence from near-static boundary conditions.},

We focus on the gravitational impulse with radiation reaction and the radiated momentum in black hole scattering at \$\$ \textbackslash mathcal\{O\} \$\$(G3) to all orders in the velocity. These classical observables require the construction and evaluation of certain loop-level quantities which are greatly simplified by harnessing recent advances from scattering amplitudes and collider physics. In particular, we make use of generalized unitarity to construct the relevant loop integrands, employ reverse unitarity, the method of regions, integration-by-parts (IBP), and (canonical) differential equations to simplify and evaluate all loop and phase-space integrals to obtain the classical gravitational observables of interest to two-loop order. The KMOC formalism naturally incorporates radiation effects which enables us to explore these classical quantities beyond the conservative two-body dynamics. From the impulse and the radiated momentum, we extract the scattering angle and the radiated energy. Finally, we discuss universality of the impulse in the high-energy limit and the relation to the eikonal phase.},

  abstract = {We define linearly reducible elliptic Feynman integrals, and we show that they can be algorithmically solved up to arbitrary order of the dimensional regulator in terms of a 1-dimensional integral over a polylogarithmic integrand, which we call the inner polylogarithmic part (IPP). The solution is obtained by direct integration of the Feynman parametric representation. When the IPP depends on one elliptic curve (and no other algebraic functions), this class of Feynman integrals can be algorithmically solved in terms of elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) by using integration by parts identities. We then elaborate on the differential equations method. Specifically, we show that the IPP can be mapped to a generalized integral topology satisfying a set of differential equations in {$\epsilon$}-form. In the examples we consider the canonical differential equations can be directly solved in terms of eMPLs up to arbitrary order of the dimensional regulator. The remaining 1-dimensional integral may be performed to express such integrals completely in terms of eMPLs. We apply these methods to solve two- and three-points integrals in terms of eMPLs. We analytically continue these integrals to the physical region by using their 1-dimensional integral representation.},

  abstract = {We develop an Effective Field Theory (EFT) formalism to solve for the conservative dynamics of binary systems in gravity via Post-Minkowskian (PM) scattering data. Our framework combines a systematic EFT approach to compute the deflection angle in the PM expansion, together with the 'Boundary-to-Bound' (B2B) dictionary introduced in [1910.03008, 1911.09130]. Due to the nature of scattering processes, a remarkable reduction of complexity occurs both in the number of Feynman diagrams and type of integrals, compared to a direct EFT computation of the potential in a PM scheme. We provide two illustrative examples. Firstly, we compute all the conservative gravitational observables for bound orbits to 2PM, which follow from only one topology beyond leading order. The results agree with those in [1910.03008, 1911.09130], obtained through the 'impetus formula' applied to the classical limit of the one loop amplitude in Cheung et al. [1808.02489]. For the sake of comparison we reconstruct the conservative Hamiltonian to 2PM order, which is equivalent to the one derived in [1808.02489] from a matching calculation. Secondly, we compute the scattering angle due to tidal effects from the electric- and magnetic-type Love numbers at leading PM order. Using the B2B dictionary we then obtain the tidal contribution to the periastron advance. We also construct a Hamiltonian including tidal effects at leading PM order. Although relying on (relativistic) Feynman diagrams, the EFT formalism developed here does not involve taking the classical limit of a quantum amplitude, neither integrals with internal massive fields, nor additional matching calculations, nor spurious ('super-classical') infrared singularities. By construction, the EFT approach can be automatized to all PM orders.},

The space of all covectors at p{$\in$}M is a vector space called the cotangent space at p; in linear-algebraic terms, it is the dual space to T p M. The union of all cotangent spaces at all points of M is a vector bundle called the cotangent bundle. Whereas tangent vectors give us a coordinate-free interpretation of derivatives of curves, it turns out that derivatives of real-valued functions on a manifold are most naturally interpreted as tangent covectors. Thus we define the differential of a real-valued function as a covector field (a smooth section of the cotangent bundle); it is a coordinate-independent analogue of the gradient. In the second half of the chapter we introduce line integrals of covector fields, which satisfy a far-reaching generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus.},

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the main tools for manipulating differential forms. The most important such tool is the exterior derivative, which generalizes the differential of a smooth function that we introduced in Chapter 11, as well as the gradient, divergence, and curl operators of multivariable calculus.

Given a smooth subbundle of the tangent bundle of M, called a distribution on M, we can ask whether there are k-dimensional submanifolds (called integral manifolds of the distribution) whose tangent spaces at each point are the given subspaces of the tangent bundle. The answer in this case is more complicated than in the case of vector fields: there is a nontrivial necessary condition, called involutivity, that must be satisfied by the distribution. The main theorem of this chapter, the Frobenius theorem, tells us that involutivity is also sufficient for the existence of an integral manifold through each point. At the end of the chapter, we give applications of the theory to Lie groups and to partial differential equations.},

The main theorem of this chapter, the fundamental theorem on flows, asserts that every smooth vector field determines a unique maximal integral curve starting at each point, and the collection of all such integral curves determines a unique maximal flow. After proving the fundamental theorem, we show how ``flowing out'' from initial submanifolds along vector fields can be used to create useful parametrizations of larger submanifolds. We then introduce the Lie derivative, which is a coordinate-independent way of computing the rate of change of one vector field along the flow of another.

On the other hand, differential forms turn out to have just the right properties for defining integrals intrinsically. After defining integrals of differential forms over oriented smooth manifolds, we prove one of the most important theorems in differential geometry: Stokes's theorem. It is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus, the fundamental theorem for line integrals, and the classical theorems of vector analysis.

The approach is as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, while making full use of the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer.This second edition has been extensively revised and clarified, and the topics have been substantially rearranged. The book now introduces the two most important analytic tools, the rank theorem and the fundamental theorem on flows, much earlier so that they can be used throughout the book. A few new topics have been added, notably Sard's theorem and transversality, a proof that infinitesimal Lie group actions generate global group actions, a more thorough study of first-order partial differential equations, a brief treatment of degree theory for smooth maps between compact manifolds, and an introduction to contact structures.Prerequisites include a solid acquaintance with general topology, the fundamental group, and covering spaces, as well as basic undergraduate linear algebra and real analysis.},

This word stems from the Latin oriens (``east''), and originally meant ``turning toward the east'' or more generally ``positioning with respect to one's surroundings.'' Orientations of manifolds generalize the idea of choosing which direction along a curve is considered ``positive,'' which rotational direction on a surface is considered ``clockwise,'' or which bases in 3 dimensions are considered ``right-handed.'' Manifolds in which it is possible to choose a consistent orientation are said to be orientable. After defining orientations, we treat the special case of orientations on Riemannian manifolds and Riemannian hypersurfaces. At the end of the chapter, we explore the close relationship between orientability and covering maps. Orientations have numerous applications, most notably in the theory of integration on manifolds, which we will study in Chapter 16.},

The answer is locally yes, but globally no. The question of which closed forms are exact depends on subtle topological properties of the manifold, connected with the existence of ``holes'' of various dimensions. Making this dependence quantitative leads to a new set of invariants of smooth manifolds, called the de Rham cohomology groups, which are the subject of this chapter. They are easily shown to be diffeomorphism invariants, but surprisingly they turn out also to be topological invariants. We prove a general theorem, called the Mayer\textendash Vietoris theorem, that expresses the de Rham groups of a manifold in terms of those of its open subsets. Using it, we compute the de Rham groups of spheres and the top-degree groups of compact manifolds, and give a brief introduction to degree theory for maps between compact manifolds of the same dimension.},

(This justifies our habit of visualizing manifolds as subsets of {$\mathbb{R}$} n .) The second result is the Whitney approximation theorem, which comes in two versions: every continuous real-valued or vector-valued function can be uniformly approximated by smooth ones, and every continuous map between smooth manifolds is homotopic to a smooth map. The third result is the transversality homotopy theorem, which says, among other things, that embedded submanifolds can always be deformed slightly so that they intersect ``nicely'' in a certain sense that we will make precise.},

The engine that powers this discussion is the rank theorem, a corollary of the inverse function theorem, which we prove in the first section of the chapter.

Motivated by the fact that vectors in {$\mathbb{R}$} n act on smooth functions by taking their directional derivatives, we define a tangent vector to a smooth manifold to be a linear map from the space of smooth functions on the manifold to {$\mathbb{R}$} that satisfies a certain product rule. After defining tangent vectors, we show how a smooth map between manifolds yields a linear map between tangent spaces, called the differential of the map, and a smooth curve determines a tangent vector at each point, called its velocity. In the final two sections we discuss and compare several other approaches to defining tangent spaces, and give a brief overview of the terminology of category theory, which puts the tangent space and differentials in a larger context.},

This leads to the concepts of tensors and tensor fields on manifolds.

  abstract = {This article aims at discussing the cosmological constant problem at a pedagogical but fully technical level. We review how the vacuum energy can be regularized in flat and curved space\textendash time and how it can be understood in terms of Feynman bubble diagrams. In particular, we show that the properly renormalized value of the zero-point energy density today (for a free theory) is in fact far from being 122 orders of magnitude larger than the critical energy density, as often quoted in the literature. We mainly consider the case of scalar fields but also treat the cases of fermions and gauge bosons which allows us to discuss the question of vacuum energy in super-symmetry. Then, we discuss how the cosmological constant can be measured in cosmology and constrained with experiments such as measurements of planet orbits in our solar system or atomic spectra. We also review why the Lamb shift and the Casimir effect seem to indicate that the quantum zero-point fluctuations are not an artifact of the quantum field theory formalism. We investigate how experiments on the universality of free fall can constrain the gravitational properties of vacuum energy and we discuss the status of the weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics, in particular the Colella, Overhauser and Werner experiment and the quantum Galileo experiment performed with a Salecker\textendash Wigner\textendash Peres clock. Finally, we briefly conclude with a discussion on the solutions to the cosmological constant problem that have been proposed so far.

En particulier, nous montrons que la valeur correctement renormalis\'ee de l'\'energie de point z\'ero maintenant (pour une th\'eorie libre) en en fait bien au dessous des 122 ordres de grandeur de l'\'energie critique de l'univers. Nous nous concentrons sur le cas des champs scalaires bien que nous consid\'erions le cas des fermions et des bosons de jauge \'egalement afin de traiter l'\'energie du vide en supersym\'etrie.

  abstract = {First published in 1973, Gravitation is a landmark graduate-level textbook that presents Einstein's general theory of relativity and offers a rigorous, full-year course on the physics of gravitation. Upon publication, Science called it ``a pedagogic masterpiece,'' and it has since become a classic, considered essential reading for every serious student and researcher in the field of relativity. This authoritative text has shaped the research of generations of physicists and astronomers, and the book continues to influence the way experts think about the subject.With an emphasis on geometric interpretation, this masterful and comprehensive book introduces the theory of relativity; describes physical applications, from stars to black holes and gravitational waves; and portrays the field's frontiers. The book also offers a unique, alternating, two-track pathway through the subject. Material focusing on basic physical ideas is designated as Track 1 and formulates an appropriate one-semester graduate-level course. The remaining Track 2 material provides a wealth of advanced topics instructors can draw on for a two-semester course, with Track 1 sections serving as prerequisites.This must-have reference for students and scholars of relativity includes a new preface by David Kaiser, reflecting on the history of the book's publication and reception, and a new introduction by Charles Misner and Kip Thorne, discussing exciting developments in the field since the book's original publication.The book teaches students to:Grasp the laws of physics in flat and curved spacetimePredict orders of magnitudeCalculate using the principal tools of modern geometryUnderstand Einstein's geometric framework for physicsExplore applications, including neutron stars, Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, gravitational collapse, gravitational waves, cosmology, and so much more},

  abstract = {We give a pedagogical introduction to time-independent scattering theory in one dimension focusing on the basic properties and recent applications of transfer matrices. In particular, we begin surveying some basic notions of potential scattering such as transfer matrix and its analyticity, multi-delta-function and locally periodic potentials, Jost solutions, spectral singularities and their time-reversal, and unidirectional reflectionlessness and invisibility. We then offer a simple derivation of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and Born series, and discuss the Born approximation. Next, we outline a recently developed dynamical formulation of time-independent scattering theory in one dimension. This formulation relates the transfer matrix and therefore the solution of the scattering problem for a given potential to the solution of the time-dependent Schr\textbackslash "odinger equation for an effective non-unitary two-level quantum system. We provide a self-contained treatment of this formulation and some of its most important applications. Specifically, we use it to devise a powerful alternative to the Born series and Born approximation, derive dynamical equations for the reflection and transmission amplitudes, discuss their application in constructing exact tunable unidirectionally invisible potentials, and use them to provide an exact solution for single-mode inverse scattering problems. The latter, which has important applications in designing optical devices with a variety of functionalities, amounts to providing an explicit construction for a finite-range complex potential whose reflection and transmission amplitudes take arbitrary prescribed values at any given wavenumber.},

We construct the massive loop integrands by Kaluza-Klein reduction of the known D-dimensional massless integrands. To carry out integration we formulate a novel method for calculating the post-Minkowskian expansion with exact velocity dependence, by solving velocity differential equations for the Feynman integrals subject to modified boundary conditions that isolate conservative contributions from the potential region. Motivated by a recent result for universality in massless scattering, we compare the scattering angle to the result found by Bern et. al. in Einstein gravity and find that they coincide in the high-energy limit, suggesting graviton dominance at this order.},

In the case of equal internal masses, the graph is reduced to three master integrals which satisfy an irreducible system of three coupled linear differential equations. The solution of the system requires finding a 3\texttimes 3 matrix of homogeneous solutions. We show how the maximal cut can be used to determine all entries of this matrix in terms of products of elliptic integrals of first and second kind of suitable arguments. All independent solutions are found by performing the integration which defines the maximal cut on different contours. Once the homogeneous solution is known, the inhomogeneous solution can be obtained by use of Euler's variation of constants.},

The equations can then be used for the numerical evaluation of the amplitudes as well as for investigating their analytic properties, such as the asymptotic and threshold behaviours and the corresponding expansions (and for analytic integration purposes, when possible). The new method is illustrated through its somewhat detailed application to the case of the one loop self-mass amplitude, by explicitly working out expansions and quadrature formulas, both in arbitrary continuous dimension n and in the n \textbackslash to 4 limit. It is then shortly discussed which features of the new method are expected to work in the more general case of multi-point, multi-loop amplitudes.},

We show how the method works for one-, two- and three-loop integrals. The new recurrence relations w.r.t. \$d\$ are complementary to the recurrence relations which derive from the method of integration by parts. We find that the problem of the irreducible numerators in Feynman integrals can be naturally solved in the framework of the proposed generalized recurrence relations.},

  abstract = {Manifolds, the higher-dimensional analogues of smooth curves and surfaces, are fundamental objects in modern mathematics. Combining aspects of algebra, topology, and analysis, manifolds have also been applied to classical mechanics, general relativity, and quantum field theory. In this streamlined introduction to the subject, the theory of manifolds is presented with the aim of helping the reader achieve a rapid mastery of the essential topics. By the end of the book the reader should be able to compute, at least for simple spaces, one of the most basic topological invariants of a manifold, its de Rham cohomology. Along the way the reader acquires the knowledge and skills necessary for further study of geometry and topology. The second edition contains fifty pages of new material. Many passages have been rewritten, proofs simplified, and new examples and exercises added. This work may be used as a textbook for a one-semester graduate or advanced undergraduate course, as well as by students engaged in self-study. The requisite point-set topology is included in an appendix of twenty-five pages; other appendices review facts from real analysis and linear algebra. Hints and solutions are provided to many of the exercises and problems. Requiring only minimal undergraduate prerequisites, "An Introduction to Manifolds" is also an excellent foundation for the author's publication with Raoul Bott, "Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology."},

The talk will give an introduction into the mathematics behind them, covering the topics of elliptic curves, elliptic integrals, modular forms and the moduli space of \$n\$ marked points on a genus one curve. The latter will be important, as elliptic Feynman integrals can be expressed as iterated integrals on the moduli space \$\{\textbackslash mathcal M\}\_\{1,n\}\$, in same way as Feynman integrals which evaluate to multiple polylogarithms can be expressed as iterated integrals on the moduli space \$\{\textbackslash mathcal M\}\_\{0,n\}\$. With the right language, many methods from the genus zero case carry over to the genus one case. In particular we will see in specific examples that the differential equation for elliptic Feynman integrals can be cast into an \$\textbackslash varepsilon\$-form. This allows to systematically obtain a solution order by order in the dimensional regularisation parameter.},

  abstract = {We investigate the behaviour of elliptic Feynman integrals under modular transformations. This has a practical motivation: Through a suitable modular transformation we can achieve that the nome squared is a small quantity, leading to fast numerical evaluations. Contrary to the case of multiple polylogarithms, where it is sufficient to consider just variable transformations for the numerical evaluations of multiple polylogarithms, it is more natural in the elliptic case to consider a combination of a variable transformation (i.e. a modular transformation) together with a redefinition of the master integrals. Thus we combine a coordinate transformation on the base manifold with a basis transformation in the fibre. Only in the combination of the two transformations we stay within the same class of functions. \textcopyright{} 2021 The Author(s)},
