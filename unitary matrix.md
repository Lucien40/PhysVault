An $n \times n$ matrix $U \in \operatorname{Mat}(n, \mathbb{C})$ with entries in the complex numbers (for $n$ a natural number) is unitary if the following equivalent conditions hold
- it preserves the canonical [[inner product]] on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$;
- the operation $(-)^{\dagger}$ of transposing it and then applying complex conjugation to all its entries takes it to its inverse:
$$
U^{\dagger}=U^{-1} .
$$
hence equivalently:
$$
U \cdot U^{\dagger}=\mathrm{I}
$$

For fixed $n$, the unitary matrices under matrix product form a [[Lie group]]: the [[unitary group]] $\mathrm{U}(n)$ (or other notations).
