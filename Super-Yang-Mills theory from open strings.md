# Super-Yang-Mills theory from open strings

Let us give a sketch of pure $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory in $D=10$ Minkowski space. This theory appears as the low-energy limit for open strings. Its field contents is

- a gauge field $A_{\mu}$ with 8 on-shell d.o.f.,

- an adjoint real chiral spinor $\Psi_{m}$ with 8 on-shell d.o.f..

It has a particularly simple action

$$
S \sim \int \mathrm{d} x^{10} \operatorname{tr}\left(-\frac{1}{4} F^{\mu \nu} F_{\mu \nu}+\gamma_{m n}^{\mu} \Psi^{m} D_{\mu} \Psi^{n}\right) .
$$

[[Supersymmetry]] acts as follows

$$
\delta A^{\mu} \simeq \delta \epsilon^{m} \gamma_{m n}^{\mu} \Psi^{n}, \quad \delta \Psi^{m} \simeq\left(\gamma^{\mu \nu}\right)^{m}{ }_{n} \delta \epsilon^{n} F_{\mu \nu}
$$

It has a vector field, a total of 16 fermionic spinor fields and $9-p$ complex scalar degrees of freedom.



By compactifying $\mathcal{N}=1 \mathrm{sYM}$ theory on the torus, the number of supercharges remains the same. Considering the available representations of spinors in different dimensions, one will find the following Yang-Mills theories to exist:

Yang-Mills field theories are the backbone of gauge theories describing our world: several of them can be combined to vield the standard model. Supersymmetric versions of YangMills theories can be obtained from the low-energy limit of open string theories. Although unrealistic, those supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories serve as prototypes and share many properties with their non-supersymmetric relatives.

Since the ends of open strings couple to D-branes, the open string spectrum carries their fluctuations. As we are dealing with a supersymmetric theory, the D-brane is stable and there is no tachyon in the spectrum. The massless modes of those fluctuations are described by $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory reduced to $(p+1)$ dimensions for a $\mathrm{D} p$-brane.
