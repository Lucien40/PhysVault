We have physically associated the metric with the gravitational potential in the [[Newtonian limit]]. Recall that
$$
g_{00}(x) \approx 1+2 \phi(x) .
$$
In Newtonian mechanics the gravitational potential satisfies the Poisson equation

$$
\nabla^{2} \phi(x)=4 \pi G \rho(x)
$$

^poissonEq

We are now seeking a generalization of the above equation which is also valid at high velocities in General Relativity. So far, we have been successful by imposing a symmetry on our GR equations. That is, the equations are symmetric under general coordinate transformations. We will use general invariance to generalise [[#^poissonEq]] as well. We will seek an equation in tensor form which collapses to [[#^poissonEq]] for weak gravitational fields.

We will start by generalizing the left-hand side of the [[#^poissonEq]]. We will seek tensors which contain second derivatives of the metric, as anticipated by the left-hand side of the equation. We will see that the possibilities are very constrained, and we call this particular tensor: [[Riemann curvature tensor]].
We then turn our attention to the right-hand side of the [[#^poissonEq]] where we will then define the [[energy-momentum tensor in GR]]. With both sides of the equation through our invariance program we can finally write [[Einstein's field equations]]. These do not in fact determine the [[metric tensor|metric]] $g_{\mu \nu }$ uniquely, and we need to impose a 'choice of gauge', which we call [[coordinate conditions]]. The conditions we impose on the coordinates suggest a wave equation based interpretation of [[Einstein's field equations|Einstein's equations]]. To see this we try to include gravity in the [[energy-momentum tensor in GR|energy-momentum tensor]]: [[energy, momentum and angular momentum with gravity]]. Now with this done we can explore some particular solutions of [[Einstein's field equations]]: [[Schwarzschild solution to Einstein's field equation]]. Another solution of much importance is that of [[gravitational waves]]. To see this we first solve the [[solutions of the linearized field equations|linearized field equations]] which make use of the [[energy, momentum and angular momentum with gravity]] to make an [[analogy with the electromagnetic field]], then identifying the [[generation of gravitional waves|sources]] and [[energy and momentum of plane gravitional waves]]
