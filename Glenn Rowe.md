##### About me

I was born in [Vancouver](http://vancouver.ca/), [British Columbia](http://www.gov.bc.ca/), [Canada](http://canada.gc.ca/) on [18 October](https://www.onthisday.com/birthdays/october/18), 1953. My birthday, coincidentally, was the same as my grandfather's.

I went through the usual years of school in Vancouver, first at [Bayview Primary School](http://bayview.vsb.bc.ca/), then at [Kitsilano Secondary School](http://kitsilano.vsb.bc.ca/), graduating in 1971.

After school, I then studied [physics and astronomy](http://www.physics.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/), graduating in 1975. I stayed on for an MSc at UBC, and then moved to the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/) to do a PhD in physics, which I obtained in 1981. After a couple of years as a post-doc in Toronto, I moved to [Monifieth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monifieth), a suburb of [Dundee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee,_Scotland), Scotland in 1984, where I've been ever since.

I was a lecturer in [mathematics](http://www.maths.dundee.ac.uk/) and then [computing](http://www.computing.dundee.ac.uk/) at the [University of Dundee](http://www.dundee.ac.uk/) from May 1984 until December 2008.

##### Books

Over the years, I've written a few books, which I list here. I suspect most of them are out of date and/or out of print by now.

-   [An Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms with Java](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0072VNGW4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i4) (1997)

##### ProgrammingPages

I'm in the process of writing a series of tutorials on programming, which [you can view here](https://glennrowe.net/programmingpages/).

##### PhysicsPages

I have also returned to my first love, physics, and am trying to relearn a lot of what I knew back in the 1970s and 1980s. I run the [PhysicsPages](https://physicspages.com/) web site where I post articles on various aspects of physics.

##### Weather Station

I have maintained a weather station in Monifieth, Scotland since July 2003. Current readings and past data archives can be found on the [weather station site](https://glennrowe.net/WeatherData/Current_Vantage_Pro.htm)
