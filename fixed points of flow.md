 Here we discuss the qualitative behaviour of the QFT model depending on its beta-function $\beta(\lambda)$. As in our above examples, we assume that $\beta(0)=0$ and we can compute the first few correction terms in $\lambda$ by means of Feynman diagrams.

Changing the scale $\mu$ changes the bare parameters of the QFT model. **This effect is called renormalisation flow w.r.t. the renormalisation scale.** It is relevant since dimensional analysis teaches us that **a shift of $\mu$ is equivalent to an opposite shift of momenta. The renormalisation flow therefore tells us how the QFT model behaves when we go to higher or lower energy scales.**

A point $\lambda_{*}$ with $\beta\left(\lambda_{*}\right)=0$ is called a fixed point of the renormalisation flow. Changing the scale $\mu$ does not change the strength of the effective interactions. The best known example is the free theory at the trivial fixed point $\lambda_{*}=0$. Since there is no coupling constant in the free theory, there is no flow. The free theory (without masses) is typically conformal.

As we go to a small but finite coupling $\lambda$ there are three cases to be distinguished.
![[Pasted image 20220127090345.png]]
- $\beta(\lambda)>0$ : The coupling constant decreases as we go to small momenta or large distances. **In the infrared region, the theory is weakly coupled and therefore our perturbative analysis is well justified here**. **Conversely in the ultraviolet region of small distances and large momenta, the effective coupling constant grows**. Eventually, the coupling may become too large, so that we cannot trust our perturbative analysis anymore. This situation is called an IR-stable fixed point.
An example for such a model is QED. The screening of electric charges makes the coupling weak for long distances but very strong for short distances.
- $\beta(\lambda)<0$ : This corresponds to a UV-stable fixed point which is the opposite of the above case. **At very short distances or large momenta the coupling becomes weak, and this is where perturbation theory can be trusted. Conversely, at long distances, perturbation theory does not provide a good description of the model.** The key example of a UV-stable fixed point is QCD. It is called asymptotically free (in the UV). Constituent quarks within hadrons can be treated well in perturbation theory when their scattering with other particles is hard. On the other hand, perturbative QCD breaks down at low energies. For instance, at the scale of hadron masses the strong interactions become very strong, and quarks are eternally bound into mesons and hadrons. This effect is closely related to confinement.
Asymptotically free theories are somewhat restricted: Among the standard interacting QFT's in four dimensions, only YangMills theories can have negative beta-functions. Furthermore, all matter contributes with a positive sign to the beta-function, so only a certain amount of matter fields are admissible in asymptotically free theories.
- A very rare third option is $\beta(\lambda)=0$ for a range of $\lambda$ 's. In this case a certain class of divergent contributions is absent, and the theory is called finite. ${ }^{23}$ This implies that the coupling constant does not depend on the scale, even though there are non-trivial interactions. We have a one-parameter family of conformal field theories with non-trivial interactions.
The best-understood example is $\mathcal{N}=4$ maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory which has a host of exiting features next to its conformality.

Now we would like to follow the renormalisation flow towards larger values of the coupling. We can do this only abstractly, since perturbation theory does not apply, but we can suppose we know $\beta(\lambda)$ exactly. We assume that $\beta(\lambda)$ returns to zero at some point $\lambda_{*}{ }^{24}$ This is a fixed point of the renormalisation flow. This point describes a conformal field theory with non-trivial interactions in general. Superficially this model may look rather different from the original perturbative model. For instance, the degrees of freedom may have effectively changed into something else. Also note that the value of $\lambda_{*}$ may not be meaningful since it could be changed by a finite reparametrisation $\lambda \rightarrow \lambda^{\prime}(\lambda)$.
Again we can distinguish two cases.
![[Pasted image 20220127090851.png]]
- $\beta(\lambda)>0$ for $\lambda<\lambda_{*}$ : The fixed point $\lambda_{*}$ is called UV-stable. As the scale of momenta increases, the flow of the coupling constant eventually halts, and the model approaches a conformal model.
- $\beta(\lambda)<0$ for $\lambda<\lambda_{*}$ : This fixed point $\lambda_{*}$ is called IR stable. As we go to larger distances, we approach a conformal model.

In these cases, the renormalisation flow interpolates between two conformal theories, one in the IR, the other in the UV. For correlation function this implies scaling laws for short and for long distances. The scaling laws are different since the models are distinct CFT's. One of them is a free field theory, the other one is typically a highly non-local field theory.
