In the previous chapter we studied the mathematical properties of tensors in General Relativity. Tensors will allow us to generalize physics laws of Special Relativity to include Gravity, by casting the corresponding equations in a covariant form for general coordinate transformations. We will show how this can be achieved in electrodynamics and particle mechanics.


We follow the program laid bare in [[covariant derivative#Importance]] and first apply to particle mechanics. We can consider its [[particle dynamics in GR|equations of motion]], and the effect of gravity on an attached [[spin in GR|spin]] vector. We then apply it to [[electrodynamics in GR|electrodynamics]].

We have developed a covariant formalism which allows us to write equations that retain their form in all coordinate systems. These equations include the effects of gravitation if in the limit of zero gravity they collapse to
valid equations of physics within special relativity. Our final recipe is simple. We take a Special Relativity equation, perform then the replacements
$$
\begin{aligned}
\eta_{\mu \nu} & \rightarrow g_{\mu \nu}(x), \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}} & \rightarrow \nabla_{\mu} \quad \text { (covariant derivation), }
\end{aligned}
$$
and then we obtain our physics law including gravity. **The only missing ingredient in order to make use of the gravitational equation is the metric $g_{\mu \nu}(x)$**. In what follows we will pave the way towards writing General Relativity equations that lead, in principle, to the [[determining the metric|determination of the metric]]. These are the so called [[Einstein field equations]].
