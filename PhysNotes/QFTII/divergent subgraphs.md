Divergent Subgraphs. We have successfully renormalised a few divergent one-loop graphs. There are, however, more divergent graphs at this level, for which we have no more counterterms at our disposal. So the question is whether the earlier counterterms automatically cancel the divergences in a all other graphs.

The divergent graphs are in fact loops where the external legs connect to tree graphs

The loop itself is the same as above, hence we already understand its counterterm. One important difference is that the divergence is no longer local since the local divergence of the loop is connected to (non-local) trees. ${ }^{12}$ This implies that no local counterterm could possibly compensate the divergence of the above graph. Nevertheless, this is not a problem since the counterterm can also act as a vertex within a tree graph.

It cancels precisely the divergence of the loop embedded into a tree because the dressing by trees in fact does not make a difference.

One can convince oneself that the above argument works in general at one loop. A simpler way to show it is to consider the effective action G: It contains only the above three divergent plain loop graphs. Dressing a loop by trees certainly makes the graph oneparticle reducible. Therefore the available three counterterms are sufficient to make $G$ finite at one loop. Converting to the connected functional $W$ does not introduce additional divergences, hence the one-loop renormalisation is successful.
