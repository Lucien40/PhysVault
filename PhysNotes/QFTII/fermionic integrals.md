#  Fermionic Integrals

1. [[Grassmann variables]]
2. [[Berezin integral]]
3. [[../math/delta function for odd Grassmann numbers]]
4. [[Fourier integrals for odd Grassmann numbers]]
5. [[Gaussian integrals for odd Grassmann numbers]]
6. [[complex Gaussian integrals for odd Grassmann numbers]]

# Summary
we must pay attention to
-   the ordering of fields (and pick up appropriate sign factors for reordering)
-   the ordering of derivatives and integration measures
-   the exponents of factors associated to integrals
