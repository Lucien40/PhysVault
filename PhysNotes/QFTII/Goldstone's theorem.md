Goldstone's theorem asserts that **for every spontaneously broken continuous global symmetry there is one massless particle with the same quantum numbers. For ordinary symmetries the particle is a scalar, called the Goldstone boson.**

One can understand the statement at the level of the Lagrangian of a model of scalar fields $\Phi^{a}$ :
- The ground state is specified by a (global) minimum $\Phi_{0}$ of the scalar potential $V(\Phi)$.
- The mass matrix is given by the curvature (second-order derivatives) of the potential at this point.
- Suppose some of the symmetries map $\Phi_{0}$ to a different point, and are therefore [[discrete symmetry breaking#^8e43ca|spontaneously broken]]. For each of these symmetries there is a corresponding direction in the space of $\Phi^{\prime}$ s where the potential $V(\Phi)$ is constant or flat.

Consequently, the eigenvalue of the mass matrix along these directions is zero.
- The remaining symmetries do not change $\Phi_{0}$, hence they are unbroken.
- The potential along the other directions is unrestricted by symmetry. There can be additional massive and massless modes, but their number or properties are not (directly) determined by symmetry.

In the [[continuous symmetry breaking]] example, the vacuum breaks the global $\mathrm{O}(N)$ symmetry to the group $\mathrm{O}(N-1)$ which preserves the vector $\Phi_{0}$. There are $N-1$ broken symmetry generators which form a vector of the subgroup. These are associated to the massless fields $\phi^{a}$ via Goldstone's theorem. The remaining field $\eta$ is massive.

Goldstone's theorem holds for any type of fundamental fields, and it applies to the full quantum theory. This is quite clear in the canonical framework in connection to [[Noether's theorem]] which guarantees the existence of a conserved current $N^{\mu}$ with associated conserved charge $Q$ :
- In the canonical framework a symmetry is generated by the [[Noether's theorem|Noether charge]] $Q$. **Suppose a [[Noether's theorem|Noether charge]] $Q$ does not annihilate the ground state $|0\rangle$. In this case the associated symmetry is said to be broken.**
- The charge $Q$ is the spatial integral over $N^{0}(\vec{x})$. In momentum space this translates to the statement $Q \sim N^{0}(\vec{p}=0)$.
-  Since $Q$ is conserved, $N^{0}$ at $\vec{p}=0$ has only the mode of energy $E=0$. This mode generates some non-trivial excitation of the ground state. ^4cfc3d
- Assuming that the above statement can be viewed as the limiting case $\vec{p} \rightarrow 0, N^{\mu}(p)$ should contain an excitation of the vacuum which has a non-trivial limit only for $E \rightarrow 0$. This excitation therefore is massless.
- Note that this guarantees that the quantum numbers of the particle match those of the [[Noether's theorem|Noether charge]] $N^{0}$ and the broken symmetry generator.
In our example, the [[Noether's theorem|Noether current]] reads $(a, b=1, \ldots N)$
$$
N_{\mu}^{a b}=\Phi^{a} \partial_{\mu} \Phi^{b}-\Phi^{b} \partial_{\mu} \Phi^{a} .
$$
Expressed in terms of the new fields we find $(a, b=1, \ldots N-1)$
$$
N_{\mu}^{a b}=\phi^{a} \partial_{\mu} \phi^{b}-\phi^{b} \partial_{\mu} \phi^{a}, \quad N_{\mu}^{N a}=v \partial_{\mu} \phi^{a}+\eta \partial_{\mu} \phi^{a}-\phi^{a} \partial_{\mu} \eta
$$
We note that for the latter $N-1$ currents, there is a contribution linear in the fields. These currents $N_{\mu}^{N a}$ indeed create (and annihilate) the massless particles $\phi^{a}$ from the ground state $|0\rangle$. Conversely, the unbroken currents $N_{\mu}^{a b}$ are quadratic in the fields and always consist of one creation and one annihilation operator, so they preserve the particle number. ^a6b82b

There are also situations where [[Noether's theorem]] is less obvious. For example, in $\mathrm{QCD}$ it can be used to argue for the lightest pseudoscalar mesons. $\mathrm{QCD}$ is a theory of spinor and gauge fields. It is strongly coupled at the nuclear scale which is substantially higher than the fundamental quark masses. At nuclear scales, it makes sense to approximate the quark masses by zero. Then the quark fields have an (approximate) axial symmetry. Suppose the axial symmetry is spontaneously broken (by a scalar expectation value of quark bilinears). This would lead to the existence of massless pseudoscalar mesons. However, since axial symmetry is not exact in the presence of fermion masses, one would expect the pseudoscalar mesons to have a reasonably small mass as well. This is the case for the pions which one could consider as the pseudo-Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously and explicitly broken axial $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ flavour symmetry relating the up and down quarks.
