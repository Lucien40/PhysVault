Dimensional regularisation makes Feynman integrals finite at the cost of introducing a [[basic integral#^9eb6e0|regularisation parameter]] $\epsilon$ and a [[introducing a scale|regularisation scale]] $\mu$. The physically relevant model is at $\epsilon=0$, but we cannot send $\epsilon$ to zero as typical results have some singularity at $\epsilon=0$. We first need to remove these singularities by redefining the parameters and fields of the model. This allows to remove the regulator by sending $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ and recover physically meaningful results. The crucial question is whether this so-called renormalisation procedure can render all observables finite at the same time.
