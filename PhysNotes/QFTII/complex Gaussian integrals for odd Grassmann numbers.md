For complex fields one usually encounters complex
Gaußian integrals. One may decompose them into
real Gaußian integrals of twice the dimension.
For a odd integration variables one finds
$$
\int \dd[n]{\theta} \dd[n]{\bar\theta}
\exp(\bar\theta M \theta)\sim \det(M),
$$
whereas the corresponding integral for even variables
reads
$$
\int \dd[n]{x} \dd[n]{\bar x}
\exp(-\bar x M x)\sim \frac{1}{\det(M)},
$$
In the latter bosonic case, the matrix $M$ should obey some
positivity constraints to make the integral convergent,
whereas the fermionic integral is indifferent to the signature of $M$.
