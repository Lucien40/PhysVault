Is to take the [[../String/Poisson brackets|Poisson bracket]] formulation of the [[../AnalyticalMech/Hamiltonian]] equations and promote them to [[commutation relation]]s of [[operators]].

# canonical quantisation
-   Canonical quantisation is intrinsically not relativistically covariant due to the specialisation of time
-   Gauge fixing the massless vector field was not exactly fun.
-   Canonical quantisation is based on non-commuting field operators
-   treat interacting models perturbatively
-   deriving Feynman rules was a long effort
-   ordering ambiguities when quantising a classical expression
