# Sources and Generating Functional



In principle, we can now compute correlators
such as

$$
\expval{\Psi(x)\Psi(y)}=
\frac{\displaystyle
\int \mathcal{D}{\Psi}\Psi(x) \Psi(y)\exp\pqty{\iunit  S[\Psi]}
}{\displaystyle
\int \mathcal{D}{\Psi}\exp\pqty{\iunit  S[\Psi]}
}.
$$

In a free theory it amounts to a [[Gaussian integral]]
with prefactors. The evaluation is complicated by
the fact that derivatives of $\Psi$ appear in the action,
and it is not immediately clear how to apply the standard methods
to deal with factors of $\Psi$ in front of the Gau√üian exponent.
Therefore, the integral should be discretised which
often leads to a involved combinatorics.
