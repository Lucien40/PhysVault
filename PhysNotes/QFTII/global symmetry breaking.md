We start by introducing the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the simple context of global symmetries. Spontaneous symmetry breaking merely obscures symmetries; the QFT models still possess such symmetries, but they are not realised in an obvious fashion. The existence of the symmetry has an interesting consequence for the particle spectrum which can be observed directly.
