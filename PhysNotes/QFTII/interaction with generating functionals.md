As soon as interaction terms are added to the [[../AnalyticalMech/Lagrangian]],
the path integral is not Gau√üian anymore,
and cannot be performed in general.
There is a simple trick to formally implement interactions
in the path integral.
The obtained expression can be evaluated perturbatively
which directly leads to the Feynman rules.
