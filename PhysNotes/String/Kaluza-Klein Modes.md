# Kaluza-Klein Modes
Compactify the coordinate $X^{25}$ to a circle of radius $R$ :
$$
X^{25} \equiv X^{25}+2 \pi R \text {. }
$$
$R$ is the compactification radius.

The quantum mechanical momentum now becomes quantised:
$$
P_{25}=\frac{n}{R} \text {. }
$$
Effectively, we obtain a tower of massive particles $M_{25}^{2}=M_{26}^{2}+n^{2} / R^{2}, 1$  ^4774f9
- zero mode $n=0$ has the original mass: this mode can be observable if the original mass is sufficiently small or vanishes. 
- Higher modes are massive. Due to $M \simeq 1 / R\implies$ practically unobservable for  small $R$. Apply $\times22$ low-energy physics can be four-dimensional effectively.


$M_{25}$ denotes the effective mass of a particle propagating in the 25 non-compact dimensions whereas $M_{26}$ denotes the original mass of the particle propagating in all 26 dimensions. #notation
