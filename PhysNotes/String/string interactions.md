# String Interactions.
Let us briefly discuss interacting strings. In general, open and closed strings interact:

- Interactions of open strings certainly involves that two ends of string can join.

When the two ends belong to a single open string, this string closes.

Therefore an interacting theory of open strings must include closed strings. This is achieved by several string "vacuum" states in the Hilbert space in same theory, e.g. $|0 ; q\rangle_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $|0 ; q\rangle_{\mathrm{o}}$.

- The opening of strings can be suppressed. Closed strings can live on their own with interactions splitting or joining stings.

We conclude that string theory necessarily contains gravitational d.o.f.; It may or may not include gauge field(s) from open string sectors.
