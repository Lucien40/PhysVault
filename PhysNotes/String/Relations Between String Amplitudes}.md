# Relations Between String Amplitudes

The observables of a string theory are the scattering amplitudes. While the calculation of those objects has been explained before, one can obtain additional information by considering their [[worldsheet]] origin: beyond the obvious cyclicity and reflection symmetry one can - using complex analysis - relate further [[worldsheet]] calculations and thus derive relations between the corresponding amplitudes. There are two distinct approaches: combining two open-string worldsheets into a closed one will lead to the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations. Choosing different contours for the evaluation of an open-string amplitude will lead to the monodromy relations between those. Nicely, both relations survive the lowenergy limits and thus carry over to the amplitudes in corresponding four-dimensional field theories.
