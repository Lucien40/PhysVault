- D $p$-branes are $(p+1)$-dimensional submanifold of spacetime.
- The submanifold includes the time direction, it has signature $(p, 1)$.
- [[6 Open strings and D/Dirichlet boundary conditions|Dirichlet conditions]] for the $D-p-1$ orthogonal directions of the submanifold.
- [[Neumann boundary conditions|Neumann conditions]] along the remaining $p+1$ directions along the submanifold.
- [[.md|D-branes]] can be curved submanifolds. 
- Open strings with pure [[Neumann boundary conditions|Neumann conditions]] can be viewed as a spacetime-filling $\mathrm{D}(D-1)$-[[.md|brane]].
- [[T-Duality]] maps between $\mathrm{D} p$-[[.md|branes]] and $\mathrm{D}(p \pm 1)$-[[.md|branes]].

Strings propagate on backgrounds with [[.md|D-branes]]:
- The bulk spacetime curvature governs the propagation of the string bulk,
- [[.md|D-branes]] govern the propagation of string ends.

There is even more to [[.md|D-branes]] as non-perturbative objects: We will continue this discussion later.
