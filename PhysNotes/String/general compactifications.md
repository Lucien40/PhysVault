# 5.5 General compactifications
There are many choices and parameters for a simultaneous compactification of several dimensions, e.g..:
- sphere $S^{n}$,
- product of spheres $S^{a} \times S^{n-a}$ with different radii,
- torus $T^{n}, 3 n-3$ moduli (radii, tilts),
- other compact manifolds.

The low-lying (that is, observable) modes are determined by this compactification manifold. In string theory, one of the main goals is to find a suitable manifold leading to a description of the standard model of particle physics as a low-energy limit. In general, massless string modes implement gauge symmetries.
The compactifications mentioned above are in no way exhaustive: there exists a plethora of further mechanisms, which are targeted to implementing the desired features of the standard model. In particular when considering the superstring, the situation changes dramatically: the critical dimension is now $D=10$ and there is no tachyon any more. On the contrary, compactification typically breaks [[Supersymmetry]]. In order to preserve one [[Supersymmetry]], the compactification manifold must be a so-called Calabi-Yau three-fold. This is the reason why Calabi-Yau manifolds are of interest to string theorists.
