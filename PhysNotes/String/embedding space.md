Or Ambient space, is the real world space in which the particle or [[Strings|string]] lives. Usually this is $3+1$ dimensional [[../QFTII/spacetime]], but sometimes in [[1 Intro and Motivation/1.1 Point to string/String theory framework|string theory]], we work with $D+1$ dimensional [[../QFTII/spacetime]].
