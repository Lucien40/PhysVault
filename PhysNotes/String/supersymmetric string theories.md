# Supersymmetric string theories

In previous chapters, the main concepts and tools of string theory have been introduced on the example of bosonic string theory: worldsheet and [[embedding space|target space]], conformal field theory as well as string scattering. One important concept, however, is missing: [[Supersymmetry]]. Introducing [[Supersymmetry]] on the worldsheet or in [[embedding space|target space]] effectively leads to a symmetry between bosons and fermions, which can be expressed as a translation in the appropriate superspace. The main tool in this section are - beyond the newly introduced [[Supersymmetry]] - going to be effective actions (the action for a quantum field theory in [[embedding space]] reproducing the string scattering amplitudes via Feynman rules) and various types of compactifications.

Adding fermionic degrees to the bosonic ones considered so far has the following consequences:

- [[Supersymmetry]] is inevitable.
- Critical dimension is reduced from $D=26$ to $D=10$.
- Stability is increased.
- The closed string tachyon is absent. We also find stable D-branes.
- There are several formulations of the same string theory related by dualities.
