$$
X'(\xi)=\partial_{\sigma} X^{\mu}(\tau,\sigma)=0 \quad \text { at } \sigma=0, \pi
$$
Because there is no restriction on $\delta X^{\mu}$, this condition allows the end of the string to move freely. 

The [[Virasoro constraints]]  imply that the end points move at speed of light
$$
\dot{X}^{2}=0
$$
Why? [[Temporal Gauge]] with $X^{0} \equiv t=R \tau$, for some dimensionful constant $R$. Then, as in [[Virasoro constraints#^660906]] the constraints read
$$
\dot{\vec{x}} \cdot \vec{x}^{\prime}=0 \quad \text { and } \quad \dot{\vec{x}}^{2}+\vec{x}^{\prime 2}=R^{2}
$$
But at the end points of the string, $\vec{x}^{\prime}=0$. So the second equation tells us that $|d \vec{x} / d t|=1$. Or, in other words, the end point of the string moves at the speed of light.
