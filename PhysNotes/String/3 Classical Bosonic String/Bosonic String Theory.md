One possible [[../1 Intro and Motivation/1.1 Point to string/String theory framework]] is that of the [[.md|bosonic string]], where we consider particles with bosonic characteristic only. The [[../Strings|strings]] will be parametrised with 2 variables and thus will swipe out a two-dimensional [[../worldsheet]] on which the dynamics in the [[../embedding space]] (or [[../embedding space|ambient space]]) will be modelled^[[[broedela-3 Classical Bosonic String#^652893]]]. Crucially we consider the [[../embedding space]] a [[../Minkowski space]], with the [[metric]] $\eta_{\mu \nu}$    (c.f. [[../1 Intro and Motivation/1.1 Point to string/Conventions|_|]]). ^13c909

The dynamics will be encoded in an [[../../AnalyticalMech/Action|action]]. The [[../Strings|string]] generalisation of the [[../Worldline action for a relativistic point particle]] is the [[Nambu-Goto action|#|]] and the more quantisable [[einbein) Action](../Polynomial (einbein|Polynomial (einbein) Action]]%20Action.md) analogue is the [[Polyakov action|#|]].
