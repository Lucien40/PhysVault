Let $\left\{\phi^{a_{1}}\left(x_{1}\right), \ldots, \phi^{a_{n}}\left(x_{n}\right)\right\}$ be a set of free scalar fields. There may be a whole bunch of them with different masses and so on. The normal-ordered product of the fields, indicated by colons on either side,
$$
: \phi^{a_{1}}\left(x_{1}\right) \phi^{a_{2}}\left(x_{2}\right) \cdots \phi^{a_{i}}\left(x_{i}\right):
$$
means that this is not to be interpreted as the ordinary product, but instead is the expression reordered with all annihilation operators on the right and a fortiori all creation operators on the left.

That is the definition of normal ordering, of this normal ordered product of a string of free fields. I don't have to tell you the order of the annihilation operators because they all commute with each other. Just break every field up into its annihilation and creation parts, and you shove all the annihilation parts on the right. If the expression involves a sum of products, each of those terms is redefined by sticking all the annihilation operators on the right. This seems like a dumb definition. Nevertheless, take my word for it, this concept will be very useful to us in the sequel.
