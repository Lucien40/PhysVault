Want $q_i(t)$ between known boundary times $t_1$ and $t_2$, subject to the constraint: $q_i (t_1)$ and $q_i (t_2)$ fixed^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^645ab9]]]


There are an infinite number of possible paths and each path is specified  $q_i (t)$ (which in turn determines $\dot{q_i}(t)$). Each choice of path gives a different form for the [[ Lagrangian]]^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^f2b5a1]]]
