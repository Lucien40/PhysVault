# In [[../String/Classical Particle Mechanics]]
We define a lagrangian of a system of N particles in 3-d space, for a total of 3N [[degrees of freedom]]^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^f4974d]]] as

[[../../Zotero/zotero-843-Annotations#^323fd0]]^eqlang

is the [[../GR/kinetic energy]] (that depends only on velocities $\dot{q_i}$^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^dd1fcc]]]) and V is the [[potential energy]] (that depends only on positions $q_i$^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^32ca1d]]]) 

## Mathematically 
it is a [[function]]^[[[Is the Lagrangian density a functional or a function]]] of the [[Particle Dynamics]].

The equation is ([[#^eqlang]])![[../String/Strings#^excit]]

![[Why are position and velocity treated independently#Why can we take q_i and dot q_i as independent in the Lagrangian lagrangian zotero-843-Annotations af8f23]]

# In [[../FT/Classical Field Theory]]

It is a [[../math/functional]] of the [[Field|fields]] and a [[function]] of time since we define it as:

$$L[\phi^r,\phi^r_{,\mu},q^\mu]=\int\!\mathcal{L}(\phi^r,\phi^r_{,\mu},q^\mu)~\mathrm{d}^nq^i$$


From the [[.md|Lagrangian]] we can define:
- [[Action]]
- [[Particle Dynamics]]
