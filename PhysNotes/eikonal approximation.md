6.5 EIKONAL APPROXIMATION
This approximation covers a situation in which $V(\mathbf{x})$ varies very little over a distance of order of wavelength $\bar{\lambda}$ (which can be regarded as "small"). Note that $V$ itself need not be weak as long as $E \gg|V|$; hence the domain of validity here is different from the Born approximation. Under these conditions, the semiclassical
