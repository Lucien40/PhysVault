Kosower, Maybee, and O’Connell framework


Original paper:
[[@kosowerAmplitudesObservablesClassical2019]]

allows us to extract classical observables directly from scattering amplitudes and what are essentially unitarity cuts.^[![[@bernScalarQEDToy2021annotations#^cccd89]]]

We want to scatter a two particle [[LSZ reduction|in state]] into a two particle [[LSZ reduction|out state]].
