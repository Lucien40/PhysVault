These solutions of [[Bessel's equation]] are denoted by $H_{v}^{(1)}(z)$ and $H_{v}^{(2)}(z)$, and their defining properties are given by

$$
H_{v}^{(1)}(z) \sim \sqrt{2 /(\pi z)} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\left(z-\frac{1}{2} v \pi-\frac{1}{4} \pi\right)}
$$
as $z \rightarrow \infty$ in $-\pi+\delta \leq \mathrm{ph} z \leq 2 \pi-\delta$, and
$$
H_{\nu}^{(2)}(z) \sim \sqrt{2 /(\pi z)} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\left(z-\frac{1}{2} v \pi-\frac{1}{4} \pi\right)}
$$

as $z \rightarrow \infty$ in $-2 \pi+\delta \leq \operatorname{ph} z \leq \pi-\delta$, where $\delta$ is an arbitrary small positive constant. Each solution has a branch point at $z=0$ for all $v \in \mathbb{C}$. The principal branches correspond to principal values of the square roots, again with a cut in the $z$-plane along the interval $(-\infty, 0]$.
The principal branches of $H_{v}^{(1)}(z)$ and $H_{v}^{(2)}(z)$ are two-valued and discontinuous on the cut $p h z=\pm \pi$.
For fixed $z(\neq 0)$ each branch of $H_{v}^{(1)}(z)$ and $H_{v}^{(z)}(z)$ is entire in $v$.
