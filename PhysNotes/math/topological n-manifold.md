A topological n-manifold is a topological space $(E, \mathcal{T})$ with the following properties:
i) $(E, \mathcal{T})$ is  [[Haussdorff]] $\left(T_{2}\right)$
ii) $(E, \mathcal{T})$ is [[locally Euclidean]] of dimension $n$
iii) $(E, \mathcal{T})$ has a [[countable]] basis of open sets, i.e $\exists$ [[countable]] subset $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{T}$ such that every open set $U$ in $E$ is the union of a collection of open sets of the basis $\mathcal{B}$.
