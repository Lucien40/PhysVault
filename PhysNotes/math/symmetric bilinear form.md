A [[.md|symmetric bilinear form]] is exactly this, a [[bilinear form#^symmetric|symmetric]] [[bilinear form]].
# Inner product

One can define an [[inner product]] using a [[.md|symmetric bilinear form]]. The [[inner product|Hermitian inner product]] reduces to this when not considering complex numbers.

# Signature
A [[.md|symmetric bilinear form]] defines a [[quadratic form]], and one can thus define its signature, based on its [[bilinear form#Associated matrix|matrix representation]] $[B]$:


There always exists a change of variables given by an invertible matrix, not necessarily orthogonal, such that the eigenvalues of $[[signature|B]] of the bilinear form** is the triple ( $n_{0}, n_{+}, n_{-}$), where $n_{0}$ is the number of $0$ s and $n_{\pm}$is the number of $\pm 1$s. 

We can identify the [[semi)definiteness]((semi|(semi)definiteness]]definiteness.md) of the form from the [[(semi]]definiteness.md#From%20signature%7Csignature)

A real vector space with an indefinite nondegenerate quadratic form of index $(p, q)$ (denoting $p 1$ s and $q-1 \mathrm{~s}$ ) is often denoted as $\mathbb{R}^{p, q}$ particularly in the physical theory of spacetime.
