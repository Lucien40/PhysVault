Another representation which exists in any [[Lie algebras|Lie algebra]] is the trivial one (typically defined on a one-dimensional space $\mathbb{V}$ ). For $a \in \mathfrak{g}$ and $h \in \mathrm{G}$
$$
\operatorname{triv}(a):=0, \quad \operatorname{triv}(h):=\mathrm{id} .
$$
In Yang-Mills theory, fields transforming in the trivial representation would not interact (directly) with the gauge fields.
