Given a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$, then their coset object is the [[quotient]] $G / H$, hence the set of equivalence classes of elements of $G$ where two are regarded as equivalent if they differ by right multiplication with an element in $H$.

If $G$ is a topological group, then the quotient is a topological space and usually called the coset space. This is in particular a homogeneous space, see there for more.
