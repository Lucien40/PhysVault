The definition of a representation $R$ of a [[Lie theory]] $\mathfrak{g}$ is analogous to that of [[lie group representation|lie groups]]. It is a linear map from the algebra to endomorphisms (linear operators) of some space $\mathbb{V}$
$$
R: \mathfrak{g} \rightarrow \operatorname{End}(\mathbb{V}) .
$$
The representation must reflect the [[Lie bracket]] of $\mathfrak{g}$ as a commutator $[A, B]:=A B-B A$ of operators, i.e. for all $a, b \in \mathfrak{g}$
$$
R([\![ a, b ]\!])=[R(a), R(b)] .
$$
The representation of [[Lie bracket|Lie brackets]] in terms of commutators is compatible with their properties: The commutator is evidently [[bilinear form|bilinear]], anti-symmetric, and it obeys the [[Lie bracket|Jacobi identity]].

The operator $R(a) \in$ End $(\mathbb{V})$ is called the representation of the elements  $a \in \mathfrak{g}$.
