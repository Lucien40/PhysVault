Let us now introduce some basic elements of [[Lie theory]], in particular those which will be relevant to Yang-Mills theory. Fields have particular transformation properties under gauge transformations. Mathematically, their transformation rules are described by representations.

![[lie group representation]]

By focusing on the unit element, it is clear that **every representation of $G$ has an associated representation of $\mathfrak{g}$.** The converse does not exactly hold due to potential global issues of the group G. For example, only a discrete subset of the one-dimensional representation $R_{x}(\varphi):=(x \varphi), x \in \mathbb{R}$, of $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{u}(1)=\mathbb{R}$, lifts to representations $R_{n}(\varphi):=\left(\mathrm{e}^{i n \varphi}\right), n \in \mathbb{Z}$, of $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{U}(1)=S^{1}$ because the latter must respect the fact that rotations by $2 \pi$ are trivial.

The space $\mathbb{V}$ is called a representation space or a module of the group or algebra . The dimension $D^{R}$ of the representation $R$ is defined as the dimension of $\mathbb{V}$
$$
D^{R}=\operatorname{dim} R:=\operatorname{dim} \mathbb{V}
$$
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">In Yang-Mills theory, fields belong to a representation space $\mathbb{V}$, while the representation $R$ of the Lie group $\mathrm{G}$ describes large gauge transformations. The representation $R$ of the [[Lie algebras|Lie algebra]] not only describes infinitesimal gauge transformations, but also the coupling of fields to the gauge potentials</mark> .
