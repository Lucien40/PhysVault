In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix, or orthonormal matrix, is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthonormal vectors.
One way to express this is
$$
Q^{\mathrm{T}} Q=Q Q^{\mathrm{T}}=I
$$
where $Q^{\mathrm{T}}$ is the transpose of $Q$ and $I$ is the identity matrix.
This leads to the equivalent characterization: a matrix $Q$ is orthogonal if its transpose is equal to its inverse:
$$
Q^{\mathrm{T}}=Q^{-1}
$$
where $Q^{-1}$ is the inverse of $Q$.
An orthogonal matrix $Q$ is necessarily invertible (with inverse $Q^{-1}=Q^{\mathrm{T}}$ ), unitary $\left(Q^{-1}=Q^{*}\right)$, where $Q^{*}$ is the Hermitian adjoint (conjugate transpose) of $Q$, and therefore normal $\left(Q^{*} Q=Q Q^{*}\right)$ over the real numbers. The determinant of any orthogonal matrix is either $+1$ or $-1$. As a linear transformation, an orthogonal matrix preserves the inner product of vectors, and therefore acts as an isometry of Euclidean space, such as a rotation, reflection or rotoreflection. In other words, it is a unitary transformation.
