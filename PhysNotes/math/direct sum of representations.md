Suppose $R_{1}, R_{2}$ are two representations of a Lie group or algebra on the spaces $\mathbb{V}_{1}, \mathbb{V}_{2}$. The direct sum $R_{1 \oplus 2}$ of two representations $R_{1}, R_{2}$ on the space $\mathbb{V}_{1 \oplus 2}=\mathbb{V}_{1} \oplus \mathbb{V}_{2}$ is defined as the block-diagonal matrix acting on the space $\left(\mathbb{V}_{1}, \mathbb{V}_{2}\right)$
$$
R_{1 \oplus 2}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
R_{1} & 0 \\
0 & R_{2}
\end{array}\right) .
$$
The direct sum operation can be reversed to [[decomposition of representations|decompose]] representations to their building blocks.
