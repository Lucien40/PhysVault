Among the simple Lie groups, the [[special unitary group]]s $\operatorname{SU}(N)$ have the simplest structure. Moreover, the groups with $N=2$ and $N=3$ along with the abelian group $\mathrm{U}(1)$ serve as the gauge groups of the standard model. Let us therefore discuss some features of the special unitary groups and their associated algebras.
