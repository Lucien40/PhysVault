For $V$ any complex vector space equipped with a [[sesquilinear form|nondegenerate]] [[inner product|Hermitian form]] $Q$, $\operatorname{U}(V, Q)$ is the group of [[isometry|isometries]] of $V$ (i.e which preserve the inner product derived from $Q$). One may write $\operatorname{U}(V)$ if $Q$ is obvious, so that $\mathrm{U}(n)$ is the same as $\mathrm{U}\left(\mathbb{C}^{n}\right)$. By $\mathrm{U}(p, q)$, we mean $\mathrm{U}\left(\mathbb{C}^{p+q}, Q\right)$, where $Q$ has $p$ positive eigenvalues and $q$ negative ones. It is also called the **pseudo-unitary group** or **generalized unitary group**. 

The signature of the form determines the group up to isomorphism; interchanging p with q amounts to replacing the metric by its negative, and so gives the same group. If either p or q equals zero, then the group isomorphic to the ordinary orthogonal group $\operatorname{U}(n)$. We assume in what follows that both p and q are positive.
