In physics, the fine-structure constant, also known as Sommerfeld's constant, commonly denoted by α (the Greek letter alpha), is a fundamental physical constant which quantifies the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. It is a dimensionless quantity related to the elementary charge e, which denotes the strength of the coupling of an elementary charged particle with the electromagnetic field, by the formula 4πε0ħcα = e2.  As a dimensionless quantity, its numerical value, approximately 1/137, is independent of the system of units used.

While there are multiple physical interpretations for α, it received its name from Arnold Sommerfeld, who introduced it in 1916, when extending the Bohr model of the atom. α quantifies the gap in the fine structure of the spectral lines of the hydrogen atom, which had been  measured precisely by Michelson and Morley in 1887.The dimensionless gravitational coupling constant is defined in a similar way by the formula mP2αG = me2, where mP is the Planck mass.
