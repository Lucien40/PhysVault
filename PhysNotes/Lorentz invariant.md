“Scalar” and “Lorentz invariant” are synonyms in the context of Special and General Relativity.

However, it is possible to have constant tensors whose components don’t actually change when transformed, such as the Minkowski metric tensor in Special Relativity. We don’t call these “invariant”. Some people call these tensors “isotropic”; others reserve this terminology for constant tensors in Riemannian spaces, such as the Kronecker delta , rather than those in semi-Riemannian spaces.

As for indexed quantities constructed from spacetime which aren't tensors... The coordinates have one index but don’t constitute a tensor in curved spacetime. (But is a tensor.) The Lorentz transformations have two indices but aren’t tensors. Christoffel symbols have three indices but aren’t tensors.

“Scalar” means “rank-0 tensor”. “Vector” means “rank-1 tensor”. Tensors are always defined with respect to a particular transformation group, so you can have rotational tensors, Lorentz tensors, etc.
