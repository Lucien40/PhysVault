Assume $c=1, \epsilon_0=1$

The QED regime analogue to a [[post-Minkowskian expansion|PM expansion]] in gravity.

The relevant length scales are:

- [[compton wavelength]] $\lambda_c=\frac{\hbar}{m}$ where $m$ is the *mass scale*
- $r_Q=\frac{e^2 q_i^2}{4 \pi m}$ typical classical particle size (classical charge radius) for $e$ [[elementary charge]], $q_i$ particle charge in $e$ units.
- $b$ the interparticle separtation

# Classical expansion

Has the following hierarchy of scales: $\lambda_c \ll r_G \ll b$ and implies a *regime of large charges* $\frac{r_G}{\lambda_c}\gg 1 \iff \frac{e^2 q_i ^2}{\hbar} \gg 1$

The expansion is perturbative in $\frac{r_G}{b}\ll 1$
