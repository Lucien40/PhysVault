Suppose now that our "clock" is a source of light with frequency $\nu=\frac{1}{\Delta t}$. In the frame $\mathcal{O}$ the time interval between two crests of the wave is $\Delta t$.

In the frame $\mathcal{O}^{\prime}$ the lightsource moves with velocity $\vec{v}$.

The time between the emission of the two crests of the wave is exactly the same as the [[time dilation in SR|time dilation]]: $\Delta t_{em}'=\gamma\Delta t$, however between the first and second crest, the light source moved away from the observer by $v_r \Delta t'_{em}$ and thus takes an additional time of $v_r \Delta t'_{em}$  ($c=1$) to be recieved. Thus the time between reception of the two crests $\Delta t'_o$ is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta t_{o}^{\prime} & \equiv \Delta t'_{em}+v_{r} \Delta t'_{em}=\gamma \Delta t\left(1+v_{r}\right) \\
\Rightarrow \Delta t_{0}^{\prime} &=\frac{1+v_{r}}{\sqrt{1-\vec{v}^{2}}} \Delta t
\end{aligned}
$$
and the new frequency is
$$
\nu^{\prime}=\frac{1}{\Delta t_{0}^{\prime}}=\frac{\sqrt{1-\vec{v}^{2}}}{1+v_{r}} \nu
$$

We can have different shifts:

- ![[test.png#inline|70]]  if the light source is moving  **towards** the observer we have $\nu^{\prime}=\sqrt{\frac{1+v}{1-v}} \nu \geq \nu$ i.e. **blue-shift**  ^blueshift
- ![[Pasted image 20220202121212.png#inline|80]] if the light source is moving  **away** from the observer we have $\nu^{\prime}=\sqrt{\frac{1-v}{1+v}} \nu \leq \nu$ i.e. **red-shift**  ^redshift
- ![[Pasted image 20220202121401.png#inline|60]] if the light source is **not moving radially** with respect to the observer it **still will** have a **shift** due only to [[time dilation in SR|time dilation]]:  $\nu^{\prime}=\sqrt{{1-\vec{v}^2}} \,\nu \leq \nu$
