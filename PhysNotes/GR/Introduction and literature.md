The goal of this lecture series is to understand at a finer level the phenomena of gravitation. Gravity has been described successfully by Newton's theory. However, Newton's laws are theoretically incomplete. For instance, they predict a gravitational force which acts at a distance instantaneously, in contrast to expectations from [[special relativity]].

In this lecture series, we will introduce Einstein's theory of general relativity, which extends Newtonian mechanics beyond the limit of small velocities. It is also valid beyond the limit of small gravitational fields which are our typical experience within our planetary system. General Relativity is still an approximate theory as it ignores quantum effects $(\hbar \rightarrow 0)$.
# Guiding principle:
 **"[[principle of equivalence]]":**
Einstein
- Set reference frames on freely falling bodies.
- For small time intervals and in small regions of space the effects of gravity are absent!
- In that frame, we can apply the laws of [[special relativity]].
- Physics in "lab-frame "can be obtained with a coordinate transformation.

# A mathematical analogy:
**Geometry is simple locally.**
- The earth is approximately flat ... in small regions.
- But the true geometry is spherical.
# Literature:
The course will closely follow the book Gravitation and Cosmology by S. Weinberg.
In addition it will be partially based on material from:
- L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz - The classical theory of fields,
- R. Feynman - Six not so easy pieces,
- C. Misner, K. Thorne and J. Wheeler - Gravitation,
- S. Carrol - Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity.
