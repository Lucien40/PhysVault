$$
z^{2} \dv[2]{w}{z}+z \dv{w}{z}-\pqty{z^2+v^2} w=0 
$$
This equation is obtained from [[Bessel's equation]] (10.2.1) on replacing $z$ by $\pm \mathrm{i} z$, and it has the same kinds of singularities. Its solutions are called modified Bessel functions or Bessel functions of imaginary argument.
# Standard Solutions
- [[modified Bessel Function of the First Kind]]
- [[modified Bessel function of the Second Kind]]



Both $I_{v}(z)$ and $K_{v}(z)$ are real when $v$ is real and $p h z=0$.
For fixed $z(\neq 0)$ each branch of $I_{v}(z)$ and $K_{v}(z)$ is entire in $\nu$.
