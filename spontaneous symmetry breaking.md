Spontaneous symmetry Breaking

In nature we observe three kinds of vector particles $W^{\pm}$and $Z^{0}$ which are massive. In general, models with massive vector fields are non-renormalisable since the massive vector propagator screws up the power counting schemes. The only renormalisable implementation of vector fields is by means of gauge theory. [[gauge symmetry]], however, forces vector particles to be massless. Breaking [[gauge symmetry]] by brute force renders the model non-renormalisable. The way out of this paradoxical situation is spontaneous symmetry breaking.
