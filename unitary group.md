For a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the unitary group $U(n)$ is the group of [[isometry|isometries]] of the $n$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, i.e. all maps preserving the canonical [[inner product]] of $\mathbb{C}^n$. This is canonically identified with the group of $n \times n$ [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]].

It generalises to the [[indefinite unitary group]] for non canonical [[inner product]]
