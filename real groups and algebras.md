For complex Lie groups and algebras all representations are complex matrices. However, for real groups and algebras, there are further properties to characterise (irreducible) representations:
- A representation can be real, complex or quaternionic depending on the type of the matrix entries. 
- Furthermore a real, complex or quaternionic representation of a Lie group (algebra) is said to be unitary (anti-hermitian), orthogonal (anti-symmetric) or symplectic (anti-symmetric) when all its matrices have this property.

Unitary representations are evidently relevant to quantum physics. Unitary representations of finite-dimensional compact Lie groups are finite-dimensional. Unitary representations of finite-dimensional non-compact Lie groups must be infinite-dimensional.
