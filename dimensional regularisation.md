In QFT I we have used a plain momentum cutoff to regularise some divergent loop integrals. It served its purpose, but it is hard to define consistently for all conceivable processes, it breaks Poincar√© symmetry and it violates gauge symmetry.

A modern regulator without these shortcomings is dimensional regularisation. It is based on the fact that the degree of divergence of loop contributions strongly depends on the dimension $D$ of spacetime. For a sufficiently large $D$, every graph develops UV-divergences (from integrating over large momenta) whereas for small $D$ some graphs can have IR divergences (from integrating over small or lightlike momenta). The idea of dimensional regularisation is to assume the number of spacetime dimensions $D$ to be a continuous (real or complex) parameter. Here, the divergences appear as poles in $D$ at integer values.
