Let us discuss the [[BRST cohomology|physical modes]]  of the gauge and [[Faddeev-Popov ghosts|ghost]] fields in terms of [[BRST cohomology]]. For the discussion of single-particle states it suffices to restrict to the linear terms in the [[BRST transformation]] and substitute the [[BRST aux field|equation of motion]] for $B=-\xi^{-1} \partial^{\mu} A_{\mu}$ (saddle point solution). Expressed in momentum space, the resulting transformations read
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q A_{\mu} & \sim p_{\mu} C, & Q C & \sim 0, \\
Q \bar{C} & \sim p^{\mu} A_{\mu}, & p^{\mu} Q A_{\mu} & \sim 0 .
\end{aligned}
$$
We can then make the following statements:
- The BRST operator maps $\overline{C}$ to $p^{\mu} A_{\mu}$. Hence the anti-[[Faddeev-Popov ghosts|ghost field]] $\bar{C}$ is not [[BRST cohomology#^closed|closed]]. 
- The vector field $A_{\mu}$ is mapped to $p_{\mu} C$. Thus one of the four modes of $A_{\mu}$ is not  [[BRST cohomology#^closed|closed]].
- The image of $\bar{C}$ is $p^{\mu} A_{\mu}$. Therefore one of the four modes of $A_{\mu}$ is [[BRST cohomology#^exact|exact]]. It is different from the mode which is not closed since [[BRST cohomology#^exact|exact states]] are  [[BRST cohomology#^closed|closed]] by construction.
- The image of $A_{\mu}$ is $C$. Therefore the [[Faddeev-Popov ghosts|ghost field]] $C$ is  [[BRST cohomology#^exact|exact]].
- The two remaining polarisation modes of the field $A_{\mu}$ are  [[BRST cohomology#^closed|closed]] and but not [[BRST cohomology#^exact|exact]].

We observe that the anti-[[Faddeev-Popov ghosts|ghost]] $\bar{C}$ and one of the modes of $A_{\mu}$ are not closed and therefore not [[BRST cohomology#^physical|physical]]. Furthermore the [[Faddeev-Popov ghosts|ghost]] $C$ and another mode of $A_{\mu}$ are exact and therefore equivalent to the trivial state in $\mathbb{H}_{\text {phys. }}$ The two remaining modes of $A_{\mu}$ are [[BRST cohomology#^physical|physical]] because they are closed but not exact. These are precisely the two helicity modes of the massless vector field.

We conclude that the cohomology for one-particle particles describes correctly the set of physical particles. The discussion for higher number of particles is not as straight-forward due to nonlinear effects.
