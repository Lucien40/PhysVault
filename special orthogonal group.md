The special orthogonal group or rotation group, denoted $\mathrm{SO}(n)$, is the group of rotations in a Cartesian space of  dimension $n$. In other words it is the subgroup of $\operatorname{O}(n)$ with determinant 1.

This is one of the classical Lie groups. It is the connected component of the neutral element in the [[orthogonal group]] $O(n)$.

It generalises to the [[indefinite special orthogonal group]]
