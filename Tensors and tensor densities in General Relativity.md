![[Untitled 5.svg#leftwrap|300]]With the principle of equivalence, we have been able to deduce simple laws for the motion of a particle inside a gravitational field from the laws of special relativity in the absence of gravity. We could apply the same technique in order to derive more complicated laws of physics. For example, we attempt to obtain similarly the laws that govern the motion of a particle in both a gravitational and an electromagnetic field from Maxwell's theory, valid only in the absence of gravity.

However, there is an easier recipe to derive laws of physics which are consistent with the principle of equivalence. This is the method of general covariance. 

# Method of general covariance
According to this method, we seek equations that satisfy two rules
1. They are valid in all coordinate systems, i.e. they are invariant under [[general coordinate transformation|general coordinate transformations]] (maintaining the same form).
2. They are valid in the absence of gravity.

Indeed, if the criteria 1 and 2 are satisfied, then the equation will hold in all local inertial frames that can be erected at each spacetime point, as requested by the principle of equivalence.

Equations for physics laws will contain spacetime coordinates, their derivatives and fields, such as the electromagnetic field. These mathematical objects have or must be endowed with precise transformation properties under [[general coordinate transformation]]s. In what follows, we will classify their transformation properties, introducing [[scalar fields in GR|scalars]], [[vector fields in GR|vectors]], [[one-forms in GR|one-forms]], [[tensor fields in GR|tensors]] and [[densities]]. With this classification at hand, we will then be able to write equations which transform covariantly, under [[general coordinate transformation|general coordinate transformations]].
