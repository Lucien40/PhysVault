Physical results should not depend on the arbitrary choice of regularisation and renormalisation scheme. However, we have already seen that the parameters of quantum field theory models must be adjusted to the choice of renormalisation scheme in order to obtain the desired result.

Here we shall discuss the dependence of the parameters and the results on the renormalisation scheme. In particular, we have seen that the various schemes introduce a renormalisation scale which consequently appears as a new parameter for all results. We shall therefore discuss the dependence on it, called the renormalisation (group) flow, along with its implications for the coupling constants.
