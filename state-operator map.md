# State-Operator Map.
There is a one-to-one map between

- quantum states on a cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times S^{1}$ and
- [[Local Operators]] (at $z=0$ ).

Below, it will be convenient to use variables obtained by the   [[Wick rotation#In conformal field theory CFT|conformal map]]

$$
z=\exp (+i \zeta), \quad \bar{z}=\exp (-i \bar{\zeta}),
$$
where
$$
\zeta, \bar{\zeta}=\sigma \mp i \tilde{\tau}
$$

A state is then given by a wave function at constant $\tilde{\tau}=-\operatorname{Im} \zeta$.

- Time evolution is equivalent to radial evolution in the $z$-plane.
- Asymptotic time $\tilde{\tau} \rightarrow-\infty$ corresponds to $z=0$.
- [[local operator]] at $z=0$ is used to excite asymptotic wave function.
- The unit operator 1 corresponds to the vacuum.
