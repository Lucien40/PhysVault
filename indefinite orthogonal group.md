The **indefinite orthogonal group**, $\operatorname{O}(p,q)$ is the [[Lie group]] of all linear transformations of an $n$-dimensional real vector space that leaves invariant a [[bilinear form#^nondegenerate|nondegenerate]], [[bilinear form#^symmetric|symmetric]] [[bilinear form]] of [[symmetric bilinear form#Signature|signature]] $(p,q)$, where $n = p + q$. It is also called the **pseudo-orthogonal group** or **generalized orthogonal group**. The dimension of the group is $n(n âˆ’ 1)/2$.

The signature of the form determines the group up to isomorphism; interchanging p with q amounts to replacing the metric by its negative, and so gives the same group. If either p or q equals zero, then the group isomorphic to the ordinary orthogonal group $\operatorname{O}(n)$. We assume in what follows that both p and q are positive.

The group $\operatorname{O}(p,q)$ is defined for vector spaces over the reals. For complex spaces, all groups $\operatorname{O}(p, q; \mathbb{C})$ are isomorphic to the usual orthogonal group $\operatorname{O}(p+ q; \mathbb{C})$, since the transform $z_j\rightarrow \iunit z_j$ changes the signature of a form. This should not be confused with the [[indefinite unitary group]] $U(p,q)$ which preserves a sesquilinear form of signature $(p,q)$.

In even dimension $n = 2p$,$\operatorname{O}(p,p)$ is known as the split orthogonal group.


It generalises the [[orthogonal group]]
