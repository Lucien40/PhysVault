# string loops

The above results are exact as far as $\alpha^{\prime}$ is concerned. Strings on flat space are a free theory in $\alpha^{\prime}$ !

Corrections are provided when considering higher [[worldsheet]] topologies. String loop corrections correspond to adding handles to the surface: higher genus. The power of $g_{\mathrm{s}}$ reflects the [[Euler characteristic]] of the [[worldsheet]]. It turns out that at string scattering at genus $h$ requires $2 n+6 h-6$ integrations

Tree Level. At tree level the [[worldsheet]] is a sphere or a disk with $n$ punctures. [[Euler characteristic]] is $-2+n$ or $-1+n / 2$, respectively. Due to 6 global conformal symmetries, the pertinent integration is over $n-3$ points, cf. above.

One Loop. At one loop the [[worldsheet]] is a torus with $n$ punctures. Its [[Euler characteristic]] is $n$. The torus has 2 moduli and 2 shifts as global transformations. Therefore the integration is over 2D Teichm√ºller space and over $n-1$ external vertices which amounts to $2 n$ integrations. The result is expressed using elliptic and modular functions. Feasible problem! Two Loops. At two loops the [[worldsheet]] is a 2-torus with $n$ punctures and [[Euler characteristic]] $2+n$. This torus has 6 moduli, but no global shifts: Therefore we have to perform $2(n+3)$ integrations. This is very hard, but can sometimes be done. Higher-loop results are typically inaccessible.
