## Why can we take $q_i$ and $\dot{q_i}$ as independent in the [[Lagrangian|lagrangian]]?^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^af8f23]]]

Consider a simple case of an ordinary [[function]] in the 2d  $x$ âˆ’$y$ plane, such as $y = x^{2}$^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^6e5c85]]], certainly here $y$ is not independent of $x$.

Instead consider the function:^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^d3973c]]]

$$L=f(x,y)=y-x^2$$

Can obtain different curves^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^80c6c3]]] by requiring  $f(x, y)$ to be equal to various constants^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^934a08]]] and to obtain the specific curve $y = x^2$, we must impose a specific constraint on $L$, namely that $f (x, y) =0$^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^1ebbbf]]]. The same logic applies to the Lagrangian, except that the constraint is a bit more elaborate^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^df626f]]], i.e the [[principle of least action]]^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^bd2cff]]]. Once this constraint has been applied now $q_i$ and $\dot{q_i}$ are no longer independent, as $\dot{q_i}(t)$ is just the derivative of $q_i$^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^91647f]]], crucially the connection of $q_i$ and $\dot{q_i}$ emerges only after we solve the Euler-Lagrange equations.^[[[zotero-843-Annotations#^64a08d]]]
