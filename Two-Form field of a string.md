# Two-Form field of a string $(*)$

We have seen that strings couple to various fields. These couplings can be interpreted as interactions between charged objects and gauge fields. As an analogy we use a charged point particle: On the one hand, it generates a Coulomb potential around itself. On the other hand, the electromagnetic field influences its motion. These two phenomena, reaction and back-reaction, are required for consistent interactions. In this picture, the string carries a two-form charge which couples to the two-form gauge field, but which also generates a field configuration around it. In the following we will present this field configuration. Fundamental String. Consider an infinite straight string stretched along the $x^{0}$ and $x^{1}$ directions with $x^{m}=0, m=2, \ldots, D-1$.

As a charged object, the string configuration generates a two-form potential of the form

$$
B=\left(f\left(x^{m}\right)^{-1}-1\right) \mathrm{d} x^{0} \wedge \mathrm{d} x^{1},
$$

where $f\left(x^{m}\right)$ is a function of the displacement $x^{m}$ to the string. The interactions with the metric $G$ and the dilaton $\Phi$ require

$$
\mathrm{d} s^{2}=f\left(x^{m}\right)^{-1} \mathrm{~d} s_{2}^{2}+\mathrm{d} s_{D-2}^{2}, \quad \mathrm{e}^{2 \Phi}=f\left(x^{m}\right)^{-1} .
$$

The function $f$ with $r^{2}=x_{2}^{2}+\ldots+x_{D-1}^{2}$ reads $^{4}$

$$
f=1+\frac{g_{\mathrm{s}}^{2} N \kappa^{D-4}}{r^{D-4}} .
$$

One can convince oneself that these background fields $B, G, \Phi$ satisfy the low-energy effective string equations of motion essentially because $f$ is a harmonic function.

However, there is an important subtlety: The background field equations are satisfied everywhere except at $r=0$ where there is a residual term of the form $\delta^{D-2}\left(x^{m}\right)$. The latter represents a source term for the charge of the string.

- The equations of motion follow from the combination of the spacetime action and the [[worldsheet]] coupling to the two-form

$$
\int_{D} H \wedge * H+\int_{2} B .
$$

The source term $\delta^{D-2}\left(x^{m}\right)$ is absorbed by the contribution of the string [[worldsheet]].

- The charge of a string can be measured by the Gauss law via the field $* H$. We put a $(D-3)$-dimensional sphere at fixed $r$ to enclose a time-slice of the string

$$
Q=\int_{D-3} * H=N .
$$

The above string has $N$ units of charge. One can show that this number must be quantised in integers in analogy to the Dirac charge quantisation condition. It is interpreted as the number of strings residing at the plane $x^{m}=0$.

Note: A string is the same as a 1-[[Dp-branes|brane]], but the above 1-[[Dp-branes|brane]] is not a [[Dp-branes|D-brane]]: It originates from closed strings alone; it has nothing to do with open strings, in particular, open strings cannot end on it. The 1-[[Dp-branes|brane]] is the string itself, it is therefore called the fundamental string or the fundamental 1-[[Dp-branes|brane]].

${ }^{4}$ Solutions $f\left(x^{m}\right)$ with more than one centre are also permissible. Magnetic [[Dp-branes|Brane]]. An analogous solution of the string effective equations of motion describes a $(D-5)$-[[Dp-branes|brane]]. It uses a dual $(D-4)$-form potential $C$ defined through

$$
H=\mathrm{d} B, \quad * H=\mathrm{d} C .
$$

It carries a magnetic charge

$$
Q=\int_{3} H .
$$

The source is located on the $(D-5)$-[[Dp-branes|brane]](s). The coupling of $(D-5)$-[[Dp-branes|branes]] to $C$ compensates the residual source terms. This object is dual to to the fundamental string and therefore called the magnetic $\mathrm{M}(D-5)$-[[Dp-branes|brane]].
