Synopsis of the laws of General Relativity
We are now at a point where we can write the laws of gravity in General Relativity and summarize all our conventions.:
- [[metric tensor|metric]]:
![[principle of equivalence#^metric|PoE]]
and in terms of the [[infinitesimal proper time interval in SR|proper time]]:
![[principle of equivalence#^prorTimeGeneric|PoE]]
- The motion of a particle in a gravitational field is determined by [[principle of equivalence#^eomGeneric|PoE]]

![[principle of equivalence#^eomGeneric|PoE]]
- The [[affine connection]] is given by
![[principle of equivalence#^affineConnection|PoE]]and  in terms of the metric
![[affine connection#^affineconnectionFromMetric]]
- The metric can be determined by solving [[Einstein's field equations]]
![[Einstein's field equations#^EinsteinfieldEq]]

- The [[Ricci scalar|curvature scalar]] is given by
![[Ricci scalar#^09f107]]
- The [[Ricci tensor]] is given by
![[Ricci tensor#^cd7107]]
- The [[Riemann curvature tensor|Riemann tensor]] is given by
![[Riemann curvature tensor#^RiemannTensor|Riemann tensor]]

- For $T_{\mu \nu}=0$ and $\Lambda=0$ one solution of [[Einstein's field equations|Einstein's equations]] is the [[Minkowski metric]]
$$
g_{\mu \nu}=\eta_{\mu \nu} .
$$
- In our conventions we take
$$
\eta_{\mu \nu}=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)
$$

Important note: The Minkowskian metric is not the only solution of [[Einstein's field equations|Einstein's equation]]. As we will see, we can also find solutions of gravitational waves propagating in empty space.
