# path integral method
-   fully covariant framework
-   functional analysis rather than operator algebra
-   based directly on the classical action functional
-   [[gauge fixing action for EM|Gauge fixing]] for massless vector fields has a few complications which are conveniently treated in the path integral framework.
-   Feynman rules can be derived directly and conveniently
-   The path integral can be formulated well for finite or strong coupling
-   Why Not?
-   The notion of states is not as evident in the path integral
-   operators and their algebras are not natural concepts of the path integral.
-   central feature of unitarity remains obscure in the path integral
-   Canonical quantisation of fields connects immediately to the conventional treatment of quantum mechanics
