# Branes

Let us now discuss D-branes. We have learned that the ends of open strings couple to D-branes and that the open string spectrum carries the fluctuations of D-branes. Hence in superstring theory D-branes should receive fermionic degrees of freedom, let us therefore inspect the spectrum of open strings coupled to a $\mathrm{D} p$-brane:

- The massless modes are described by $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory reduced to $(p+1)$ dimensions. 
- The spectrum has a tower of heavy string modes.
- A **scalar tachyon may be present** depending on the particular situation.

# Stable $\mathrm{D} p$-Branes. 
Some D-branes are stable others are not. The **presence of an open string tachyon indicates instability of the D-brane:**

- D-branes in bosonic string theory are always unstable.
- $\mathrm{D} p$-branes for IIB superstring are stable for $p$ odd.
- $\mathrm{D} p$-branes for IIA superstring are stable for $p$ even.
- Since [[T-duality]] changes the dimension of D-branes by one unit, it must also **may map between type IIA and IIB theories.**
