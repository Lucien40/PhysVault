# Idea
A topological space is connected if it can not be split up into two independent parts.
Every topological space may be decomposed into disjoint maximal connected subspaces, called its *connected components*. 

One often studies topological ideas first for connected spaces and then generalises to general spaces. This is especially true if one is studying such nice topological spaces that every space is a coproduct of connected components (such as for example locally connected topological spaces).
# Definitions
Elementary definition

A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is connected if the following equivalent conditions hold:
1. For all pairs of topological spaces $\left(X_{1}, \tau_{1}\right),\left(X_{2}, \tau_{2}\right)$ such that $(X, \tau)$ is homeomorphic to their disjoint union space
$$
(X, \tau) \simeq\left(X_{1}, \tau_{1}\right) \sqcup\left(X_{2}, \tau_{2}\right),
$$
exactly one of the two spaces is the empty space.
2. For all pairs of open subsets $U_{1}, U_{2} \subset X$, if
$$
U_{1} \cup U_{2}=X \text { and } U_{1} \cap U_{2}=\emptyset
$$
then exactly one of the two subsets is the empty set.
