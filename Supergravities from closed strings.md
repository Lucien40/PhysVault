# Supergravities from closed strings

Supergravity Theories. Supergravity theories have a highly non-linear action, hence we shall only discuss some aspects of these theories. There are four relevant models for string theory:

- $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity in 11D: M-theory.

- $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supergravity in 10D: type IIA supergravity.

- $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ supergravity in 10D: type IIB supergravity.

- $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravity in 10D: type I supergravity. The former three theories have $128+128$ d.o.f., the latter only $64+64$. Let us list the types of fields ( $[n]$ refers to an $n$-form gauge field) in these theories along with the above gauge theory:



# Type IIA and IIB Supergravity. 
Let us start the discussion of effective actions for the closed string with the two $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravities in ten dimensions: type IIA and type IIB. As noted in the previous chapter, $\mathrm{D} p$-branes for the superstring are stable for odd $p$ in type IIA theories and stable for even $p$ in type IIB theories. This nicely fits with the fact that T-duality changes the dimension of D-branes by one unit.

As discussed in the last chapter, supergravity $p$-branes are supported by a $(p+1)$-form, gravity, antisymmetric tensor and the dilaton field. While the latter three originate in the [[Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz Superstring|NS]]-[[Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz Superstring|NS]] sector, the $(p+1)$-forms are in the [[Ramond-Neveu-Schwarz Superstring|R-]]R sector. Having only odd $p$-branes in the type IIA theory, there will be even forms in this theory exclusively. As the fermionic states of the two theories are complicated, let us stick here with the bosonic ones and collect them for type IIA and type IIB theory in the following table:

|          |             sector              |             fields             |    field strengths    |
|:--------:|:-------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------:|
| type IIA |             $NS-NS$             | $G_{\mu \nu},\Phi,B_{\mu \nu}$ | $H_{\mu \nu \lambda}$ |
|          | $\mathrm{R}^{+}-\mathrm{R}^{-}$ |         $C_{1}, C_{3}$         |    $F_{2}, F_{4}$     |
| type IIB |             $NS-NS$             | $G_{\mu \nu},\Phi,B_{\mu \nu}$ | $H_{\mu \nu \lambda}$ |
|          | $\mathrm{R}^{+}-\mathrm{R}^{-}$ |     $C_{0}, C_{2}, C_{3}$      | $F_{1}, F_{3}, F_{5}$ |
