Or local [[conformal invariance]]:

$$g_{\alpha \beta}(\xi) \mapsto f(\xi) g_{\alpha \beta}(\xi)$$
Under this symmetry, $X^{\mu}(\xi) \rightarrow X^{\mu}(\xi)$, while the metric changes as
$$
g_{\alpha \beta}(\xi) \rightarrow \Omega^{2}(\xi) g_{\alpha \beta}(\xi) .
$$
Or, infinitesimally, we can write $\Omega^{2}(\xi)=e^{2 \phi(\xi)}$ for small $\phi$ so that
$$
\delta g_{\alpha \beta}(\xi)=2 \phi(\xi) g_{\alpha \beta}(\xi)
$$

How should we think of Weyl invariance? It is not a coordinate change. Instead it is the invariance of the theory under a local change of scale which preserves the angles between all lines.^[[[broedela-3 Classical Bosonic String#^36b649]]]
