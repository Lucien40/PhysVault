# BRST Symmetry
In quantising the Yang-Mills fields, we have traded in gauge invariance for a well-defined propagator. There is still a global gauge symmetry left over in the Lorenz gauge, but it is not sufficient to guarantee many of the nice properties of the gauge-fixed theory. Becchi, Rouet, Stora and, independently, Tyutin found an extra symmetry of the gauge-fixed Lagrangian with unphysical and [[Faddeev-Popov ghosts|ghost]] degrees of freedom, the so-called BRST transformation. Despite its apparent simplicity, it is an essential tool for understanding [[BRST cohomology|physical states]] and unitarity.
