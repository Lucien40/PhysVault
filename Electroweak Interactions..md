# Electroweak Interactions.
A basic process of the electroweak interactions is beta-decay in which a neutron decays into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino
$$
n \rightarrow p^{+}+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}
$$
At the level of constituent quarks the process can be understood as the transition of a down into an up quark
$$
d^{-1 / 3} \rightarrow u^{+2 / 3}+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}
$$
These are four fundamental fields, so the interaction should somehow be modelled by the electroweak theory. **However, an interaction of 4 spinor fields has mass dimension at least 6 and consequently leads to a non-renormalisable model.**

The resolution to this problem is to couple two pairs of spinors by an intermediate field $W^{-}$
$$
d^{-1 / 3} \rightarrow u^{+2 / 3}+W^{-} \rightarrow u^{+2 / 3}+e^{-}+v
$$
Some characteristics of this interaction are as follows:
- For low energies, the decay is largely independent of the involved particle momenta. This implies that the **intermediate particle is very massive**, so that its intermediate propagator is practically constant.
- The interactions between spinors and the field $W^{\pm}$are via the vector and the axial couplings. The coupling for both types of interactions turns out to be equal leading to **maximal violation of parity** in these processes.
- A renormalisable coupling to a vector field requires a gauge theory. **Since the intermediate particles are massive, gauge symmetry must be spontaneously broken.**
- The intermediate particle $W^{-}$is electrically charged, therefore the **electroweak gauge group must be non-abelian**. In fact, it is $\mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{U}(1)$ where the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ factor is required to obtain electromagnetism after symmetry breaking. 

Let us first discuss the [[ssb for electroweak|symmetry breaking mechanism]], and then turn to the quarks and leptons as spinor matter particles.
